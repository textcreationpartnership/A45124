            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I Have met in the Book-ſellers Shop with ſome Sheets of late, put out under the pretence of a <hi>Preface</hi> to another Book: but with the deſign of ſo much <hi>Malevolence,</hi> in the abuſe of one particular worthy perſon, that I am aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the man, That ever one of parts and underſtanding, (though ſo young a Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or as he is) ſhould be ſo forſaken of his Diſcretion, of Religion, of Morality, of Ingenuity, of the knowledg of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and all diſcernment of his duty, to God and to his Neighbour, as to ſuffer this <hi>Half Book</hi> of his now upon cold blood after

If I do ſo, I am afraid it will do nothing. Shall I excuſe him as overtaken with paſſion, prejudice, haſt, precipitancy, unadviſedneſs, ſurprize? No, he will by all means be believed thus inſolent deliberately, with a <hi>compoſed mind,</hi> and upon choice. Shall I then commend his Chriſtian bravery, magnanimous charity, and pious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture in his agreſſing of <hi>one</hi> perſon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving <hi>another</hi> of ſo much eminency and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility which others are afraid to cope with, meerly out of tenderneſs of Conſcience, and great compaſſion to the ſouls of people, leaſt they ſhould be hurt by their eſteem and good name, and for no other reaſon in the World hath he done this.

               <p>For the appearance of ſome method to his Preface, this Author tells us at the beginning that he intends two things: <hi>To ſay ſomething of the Treatiſe: and ſomething of the ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of it.</hi> As for me, I have nothing to ſay of either of theſe, they require it not. Only I perceive that is not paſt four of five leaves, but himſelf hath done with theſe two particulars as inſignificant to ſpend more time upon, and then there is fourty more for him
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56450:5"/>to ramble in about the matter of his former Books, and one new matter he hath ſtarted, and againſt Doctor <hi>Owen;</hi> which indeed is the <hi>Helena</hi> that hath given life to this publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Well! I have no more to ſay to him about that Doctor: only I have one thing to offer in the way to the Doctor about him, and it ſhall be that adviſe out of <hi>Auguſtine: Si non aurem ſolum percutit iracundia criminantis, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum etiam conſcientiam mordet veritas criminis, quid mihi prodeſt ſi me continuis landibus totus Mundus attollat? Ita nec malam conſcientiam ſanat praeconium Laudantis: nec bonam vulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat convitiantis opprobrium. Cont. lit. Pet. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 7. For the Treatiſe it ſelf likewiſe of the Biſhop, I leave it to one who is able if he ſee it good to examine it. Whatſoever the Book be, or the perſon who ſeemeth to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, it maketh no matter to me, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps as little to Mr. B. I meddle not with it. But two things in good earneſt there are in this Preface of general concern, which I muſt take notice of, for the one will be worthy of our time, and the other I will not quite ſlide over.</p>

               </p>
               <p>That which I take notice of, and make not my task is this, the reſolution he offers to a certain queſtion he is pleaſed to raiſe, <hi>what danger there is of the return of Popery in this Nation.</hi> The queſtion is certainly a male-pert queſtion, and he does as briskly reſolve the buſineſs. That the Fanaticks and Athiſts are like indeed to bring it in, but elſe there is no danger at all of it. There are, he ſays, a ſort of Athiſts among us, not like thoſe of old that expecting no life to come laboured onely to live merry, and free themſelves from care, but theſe of our age ſays he are <hi>a ſort of Deviliſh and malicious wretches, whoſe proud and arrogant minds make them love miſchief for miſchief ſake.</hi> I doubt there are ſome perſons of note, greater parts, quality and ſpirit, that do ſlight this proud young man, and that that is the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of theſe words. It is hard for thoſe that come near of a trade, to like one another. The Athiſts of this age (which Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> and he, while they put conſcience under humane Authority, are like to make as faſt as they can get any to believe them) are of the ſame kind, no doubt with thoſe that have been formerly, though the age ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56450:6"/>is more wicked, and I ſee no reaſon why the <hi>Athiſt,</hi> more then the <hi>Adulterer,</hi> Drunkard, or Sweater, ſhould be willing to <hi>change</hi> the Government of our d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The truth is, it is not the Fanaticks ſo much as the Epiſcopal party that raiſe theſe jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies of Popery. The Fanaticks have no Dignities of Pluralities to looſe, and it is the looſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity,</hi> that ſo blinded their eyes and infatuated their judgments, that they will ventore the ruine of all, rather then abate any thing for an accommodation with

               <p>There are two parts of that Parliamentary Grace, which is neceſſary to this Kingdoms better eſtabliſhment. The one lies indeed in <hi>Indulgence</hi> or <hi>Forbearance</hi> towards all, which is the Nations intereſt, and this the King ſeeing hath granted: The other lies in an <hi>Accommodation</hi> or <hi>Comprehenſion,</hi> which is of thoſe only (that is ſome) that are capable, and this is the Biſhops intereſt, but their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will not ſee it. There are accordingly two ſorts of diſſenters. One that own the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Miniſtery and our Parochial Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and are in that capacity of coming in upon that account, and deſire it heartily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condeſcention to them in ſome matters: The other that own not our Churches, and ſo are uncapable to come in, and cannot deſire it or ſeek it.</p>
               <p>For the one then that which we propoſe, is only a farther latitude in the eſtabliſhed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Nation, that ſuch may be received. Let us ſuppoſe nothing elſe required of a man to be a Miniſter of a Pariſh, then there is to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56450:7"/>the Pariſhoner to be a Member of a Pariſh Church, as part of the National. If a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Baptized will come to Church and hear Common Prayer, and receive the Sacrament and does nothing to be excommunicated for it, he is, he may, and muſt be received as a Parochial member: In like manner if a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter firſt ordained (and ſo approved in his abilities for that function) will but read the Book of the Liturgy, and adminiſter the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments according to it, and does nothing deſerving ſuſpenſion, why ſhould not this ſuffice for his enjoying a Living, and exerciſing the Office to which he is called. Let theſe Declarations onely which are impoſed (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be made, ſubſcribed or ſworn) be laid aſide, or left at leaſt to our own words, and every Miniſter (out of the Cathedrals) be left to their choice about the Croſs, Surplice, Kneeling at the Sacrament, and that is the ſum of this buſineſs.</p>
               <p>For the other, it is not I count righteous or charitable, that any who were able to come in upon any ſuch <hi>relaxed</hi> terms, ſhould be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have perſecution reached forth on their Brethren that cannot. Beſides that <hi>Perſecution</hi> as well as <hi>Preferment</hi> are both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like animaters to engagement. If the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian be <hi>comprehended,</hi> he will be ſatisfied
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56450:7"/>to act in his Miniſtry without endeavouring any alteration otherwiſe of Epiſcopacy: If the Congregationaliſt be <hi>Indulged,</hi> he will be ſatisfied though he be not <hi>Comprehended.</hi> for that he cannot ſubmit unto: and ſo ſhall there be no diſobligation put on any, but all be pleaſed, and the Churches work, if the Parliament will, be ſoon done.</p>
               <p>And who is there among you that feareth the Lord, and obeyeth the voice of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>his God be with him, and let him go up to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and build the Houſe of the Lord.</hi> We have indeed his Majeſties late Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Thus ſaith Cyrus:</hi> but where are our <hi>Jeſhuahs</hi> with his Brethren the Prieſts, &amp; our <hi>Zerubbabels?</hi> Where are thoſe heads of our Tribes, whom like the children of <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> God hath made wiſe hearted to know what to do at ſuch a time as this? Alas, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of thoſe words, <hi>Let us ariſe and build,</hi> we ſhould hear the ſpeeches and read the writing of <hi>Rehun</hi> the Chancellor, and this <hi>Shimſhai</hi> his Scribe. Be it known to the King that if the City be built, It is <hi>a rebellious City and hurtful to Kings,</hi> that they have <hi>moved Sedition,</hi> in the late War, and ought to be deſtroyed. <hi>The conteſt now</hi> (ſaith the Prefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer) <hi>as it relates to the real concernments of the Nation is, which ſhall prevail Loyalty or Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56450:8"/>whether ſuch Preachers ſhould be permitted the liberty of making Proſelytes, when all that are ſeduced into their Communion, are at the ſame time alienated from the Government, and liſted into a combination againſt it.</hi> How mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably this tart Gentleman is out, he will ſee himſelf in good time, for we do all own <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,</hi> when we do not yet <hi>obey</hi> their <hi>impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> But who hath given licenſe to the man (if himſelf were not the Licenſer) to make any ſuch ſaucy reflexion in print as this, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which his Majeſty with great wiſdom hath thought fit to be done? Let him produce any of thoſe who come in and accept the Kings Grace, that can be accuſed of the leaſt <hi>diſaffection</hi> to, and much leſs of <hi>combination</hi> againſt his Government. If he mean the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal Church, why are not theſe men as ſagacious to <hi>combine</hi> us with them? Would he have the King no wiſer for his <hi>own</hi> and the <hi>Nations</hi> intereſt, than they are for <hi>theirs?</hi> It is pity this ſo neceſſary, as well as Royal and kind act of the Kings to this Nation, ſhould ſo nettle the high flowen of theſe Conformiſts. It is pity indeed, but they ſhould be offended, becauſe ſo many honeſt innocent perſons, who never did them any hurt in their lives, and yet they proſecuted with ſuch hate, have eſcaped their talons. For
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56450:8"/>my part I bleſs God in my inward Chamber, that he hath put in into the heart of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, to ſhew this kindneſs to his people. And that it may fret his and our Malignants the more, I will tell them how much the rather I am pleaſed with it, in regard of the Kings free, conſtant, univerſal recognizing of it, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to thoſe that come to him with their humble thanks and ſubmiſſion. I will record this one expreſſion of his to the Miniſters of <hi>Wilts. Go thank them</hi> (ſays he), <hi>and I will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, there ſhall never be any more perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for conſcience ſake, while I live.</hi> Theſe are words of an open, honeſt, candid, clear, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle hearted Gentleman that we may truſt, as having nothing of the counterfeit in them in the Earth. Theſe are words that I think may ſerve us, ſo long as by our prayers we can keep him, and make thoſe that envy us look black. I do therefore ſet this up for my ſtone of remembrance, and I will engrave my ſhort inſcription on it. <hi>Hitherto.</hi> For it is true there is ſomething moreover that ſome of us would have, but not of the King. To let in any into the publick Vineyard, and to make it ſignifie, muſt be by an Act againſt plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities with it. His Majeſty does ſee that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion</hi> does draw deeper than his <hi>ſingle</hi> will. And who ſhall come <hi>come after the King,</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:56450:9"/>that hath once talkt with him, for <hi>knowledg</hi> in this matter? <hi>Seeing therefore, that by thee we enjoy much quietneſs, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this Nation by thy provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, we accept it always, and in all places moſt noble</hi> Felix <hi>with all thankfulneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what, does not the King aſſume an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in this Declaration more than he hath, when he himſelf diſpenſes with an Act and Acts of Parliament? and what ſay you to that? I anſwer, I will not take upon me to decide ſuch a caſe as this is, which belongs to the Lawyers: but as a Divine, ſo far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is concerned, (and it is but a mans own conſcience he goes by) I will ſpeak my opinion. The King himſelf does tell us that the Law does give him ſuch a ſupremacy as this in Eccleſiaſtical matters, and that it is aſſerted in ſeveral Statutes. Now what reaſon there is for any of us to believe contrary to his aſſertion, unleſs we our ſelves were better <hi>lawyers</hi> than his Council &amp; He, I know not. I will take the hint from this man, <hi>Elias dicat quando venerit.</hi> We all know that the <hi>King</hi> hath power to diſpenſe with ſome <hi>Laws,</hi> &amp; for any <hi>Lawyer</hi> to undertake to lay down the preciſe critical note of difference between thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> which he may ſuſpend, &amp; thoſe he may not, I believe will be hard: whereas we that go only by Politicks in general think this moſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56450:9"/>eaſie. The <hi>Supream</hi> Law muſt over-rule all <hi>under</hi> it; and in all human Laws <hi>ſalus Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicae</hi> is <hi>ſuprema lex.</hi> It is certain, when any Laws prove diſadvantageous to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, they themſelves <hi>grow</hi> into diſuſe; and when we have power to ſuſpend our <hi>duty,</hi> why the King as Executor of the Law, may not ſuſpend the <hi>penalty,</hi> or may not proceed ſo far as this <hi>Declaration, Elias dicat quando venerit.</hi> The King I ſuppoſe may call the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy to make Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions, and by his Authority alone, without a Parliament, ratifie or put a ſanction on them: &amp; whether then he may not do as much as he hath done for us in this gracious Indulgence, <hi>Elias dicat quando venerit.</hi> I have obſerved in reading the Statute-Book wherein the King's Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy is concern'd againſt the Pope. That the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is called <hi>Imperial:</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that be any thing or no, to ſignifie his Authority to be abſolute without his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in matters Eccleſiaſtical though not in Civil) I cannot tell; but if it be, <hi>Elias dicet quando venerit.</hi> When in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time they took away the Supremacy from the Pope, they gave the ſame to the King: and if the Popes Authority in Eccleſiaſticals was undoubtedly over the Parliament, whether the Kings may not be ſo alſo, <hi>Elias dicat
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56450:10"/>quando venerit.</hi> We know that the ſole power of the <hi>Militia,</hi> which is one <hi>Right of Majeſty,</hi> is declared to lye in the King, in ſome late Acts, when <hi>Legiſlation</hi> and the <hi>Purſe</hi> belongs not to him without his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and why he may not have ſuch a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy in <hi>Eccleſiaſticals</hi> which he hath not in <hi>Civils,</hi> as well as <hi>one</hi> of the Rights of Majeſty and not <hi>others,</hi> according to the temperature of our <hi>mixt State, Elias dicat quando venerit.</hi> Above all, could we ſuppoſe the whole Nation convened, and were to give their vote, whether the King ſhould have this power he hath exerted, or whether it ſhould lye in the power of <hi>this preſent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> and not in Him alone, I believe the major vote would be for the King. And when in the erecting of Commonwealths it is the conſent of the people, is that which is the <hi>conditio regnandi,</hi> or <hi>cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> &amp; the Authority of ſelf flows <hi>immediately from God</hi> upon that condition being put: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Prince who is perſwaded in his conſcience, he does nothing but that for which he hath the hearts &amp; good-wills of the generality, as in this good deed of his Majeſty in this Declaration, he may not have a good conſcience toward God, however he be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by men, or the Sages of the Law, I muſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56450:10"/>leave that alſo till <hi>Elias</hi> come: <hi>Elias dicet quando venerit,</hi> as the Jews ſpeak. I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with that ſaying however of <hi>Bracton. Si ab co peccatur, locus erit ſupplicationi quod factum ſuum corrigat &amp; emendet, quod quidem ſi non fecerit ſatis erit ei ad paenam quod Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num expectet ultorem. Nemo enim de factis ſuis praeſumat diſquirere, multo minus contra factum venire, Brac. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>But again in point of Divinity. Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm, and Popery, is ſin, Idolatry; and may <hi>ſin,</hi> any ſin be tolerated? I diſtinguiſh, there is a <hi>Private,</hi> and <hi>Publick</hi> Toleration: and publick Toleration is either in the <hi>Church,</hi> or in the <hi>State.</hi> No ſin is to be <hi>privately</hi> tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, but every ſoul is bound to renounce every ſin, and to live in no evil courſe of life with will and knowledge unto death, upon pain of damnation. Again, no ſin may be tolerated <hi>publickly</hi> by the Miniſter, but he is to reprove all, and ſpare none, that he may deliver his own ſoul: Beſides, if any ſin be lived in contumaciouſly to the ſcandal of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſuch ſinners are not to be tolerated in the <hi>Church,</hi> but to be caſt out till they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. But to think that no ſin therefore muſt be tolerated by the Magiſtrate in the <hi>World,</hi> or in the <hi>State,</hi> without conſidering whether it be conſiſtent or no with the publick peace
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56450:11"/>or welfare which is external, is a thought that muſt be unthought again. For the world are Idolators, <hi>the World lyes in wickedneſs,</hi> and if the wicked be caſt out of the <hi>Church,</hi> it is into the <hi>World</hi> they are caſt. Nay ſurely, if God had appointed every ſin to have its pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment in this World, what need were there of a general Aſſizes in the next? <hi>I wrot to you, not to company with Fornicators: yet not altogether with the Fornicators of this World, or with the Covetous, or Extortioners, or with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, for then muſt ye needs go out of the World.</hi> This is certain, God does ſuffer ſin to be, when he might hinder it, and that by a courſe of Juſtice, if he would immediately ſtrike men dead, for example. I cannot but judge therefore, that though no <hi>ſin</hi> may be <hi>done</hi> by the Magiſtrate himſelf, nor may he be partakers of it with others, <hi>that good may come of it:</hi> yet may he tolerate the ſinner in his ſin which he concurs no ways in, as God permits it in the World, <hi>viz.</hi> when a greater good does accrue to his ſubjects by that To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration, then by the Puniſhment. Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh (ſay Divines) between <hi>cogere ad fidem,</hi> and <hi>interdicere exercitio in heterodoxia. Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius ad euitandum corruptionem &amp; ſcandala competit Magiſtratui.</hi> Diſtinguiſh again (ſay they) of a Common-wealth or Kingdom
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56450:11"/>
                  <hi>free,</hi> and <hi>not free</hi> from diverſe Religions. <hi>Ibi cavendae, hic tolerandae, ſed cum conditione ne pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blica Religionis exercitia facile concedantur.</hi> One would think his Majeſty no ſmall caſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtica Divine, by the carriage of this Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I will cloſe this up with that pertinent paſſage and Comment of <hi>Auguſtine. Cum Apoſtolus precipit nolite iungi cum infidelibus, exite de medio corum, non intelligunt neminem coniungi cum inſidelibus niſi qui facit peccata Paganorum, vel talia facientibus favet: nec quunquam fieri participem iniquitatis, niſi ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam vel agat, vel approbat. Contra Epiſtolam Parmeniani, l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>After this, I muſt confeſs as to Popery, I do hope that there is indeed no <hi>Foundation</hi> of thoſe ſurmiſes which this Prefacers queſtion muſt buzze amongſt us, for all his ſaying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, <hi>that there is none.</hi> For to go to bring in a Religion upon a people which is no more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for it, then we are for Popery in this Nation, were but the committing of a rape or raviſhment upon the publick conſcience; and poſſeſſion being got without getting our good wills, could not likely be long retained, nor could be loſt again neither, but with an exceedingly encreaſed diſadvantage to that party. Nevertheleſs ſeeing our Prefacer hath offered the ſuppoſition, I do both declare the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56450:12"/>effectual means to prevent it, and who they are muſt be the cauſe of it, if the event comes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</p>
               <p>But the Kings Majeſties Declaration I know ſticks ſtill in their ſtomacks. <hi>The penal Laws are taken off from the Papiſts, and from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks.</hi> And what then? I do believe we ſhall have never the more <hi>Papiſts</hi> nor <hi>Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> for that. No, they have one Argument, <hi>Difficulty and Suffering</hi> the leſs, for their Church. The penal Laws did but whet their appetite, their own fulneſs will ſerve to cloy them, and give them enough. But the Church is divided, diviſion countenanced, and is not Schiſm and Separation forbidden? <hi>It hath been declared to me of you, that there are contentions among you.</hi> I anſwer, the Kings Declaration found theſe Diviſions in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it does not make them. Diviſion and Separation ſimply conſidered, are neither good nor evil. There may be reaſon to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide or ſeparate ſome perſons from others out of prudence, as the Catechumens from the fully inſtructed of old, for their greater edification. It is not all diviſion or ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is Schiſm, but ſinful diviſion. Such <hi>Diviſions</hi> as the Apoſtle here alſo calls <hi>Contention.</hi> I muſt confeſs I have been a man profeſſed ſtill againſt Separation: but this Declaration does
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56450:12"/>ſeem to me to take away the very ſore it ſelf which was in our ſeparate Meetings till now. It is by Gods providence a <hi>Medicinal Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> And I will tell you my thoughts freely, as I uſe to do when I write. I look upon the <hi>call</hi> of a Nation to the Chriſtian Religion, and and the Nations <hi>anſwering that call,</hi> to make a Church National. The King is head over his people as a Nation, and that in Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticals, as well as Civils. As National head he hath appointed the Parochial Churches, and required that all his Subjects ſhould fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent theſe Aſſemblies for the acknowledging, glorifying, or National ſerving and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping the true God, and Jeſus Chriſt, whom we have received. This worſhip and ſervice in the nature of it being intrinſecally good, and the external order (ſuch as that of place and the like circumſtances) being properly under his juriſdiction, it hath ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hitherto to me, that unleſs there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in that order or way by him preſcribed which is ſinful, and that required too as a condition of that Communion, there is no man might refuſe his attendance on thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial Aſſemblies, without the ſin of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and conſequently his ſeparation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by becomming ſinful, it was Schiſm. Now Sirs! It having pleaſed the Almighty to put
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56450:13"/>it into the heart of the King, not onely to forbear and connive at the Non-Conformiſt in their Preaching, but to allow, appoint, and deſign by his ſolemn Declaration, ſtated pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for their Aſſemblies (according to the good hand of our God upon him) it does appear to me that theſe particular Aſſemblies, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Authority of the Supreame Head of the Church, equally with the Pariſh Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, they are manifeſtly conſtituted thereby parts of the Church National, whereof he is Head, no leſs then the Pariſh aſſemblies. The matter is all one, as if a Pariſh onely which was too big, ſhould be divided into two, where I ſay there is <hi>Separation,</hi> no <hi>Schiſm.</hi> I will undertake to make it good, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Conſecration of a Church is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to the making the Society that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles therein to be a particular Church, or part of the National: but that the Kings Authority alone is enough for that Relation. Nay I know not but the King upon the ſame account might conſtitute <hi>unmaintenanced</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops over thoſe particular Congregate Churches, if he pleaſed, as well as he hath <hi>maintained</hi> Biſhops over thoſe that have Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, if it were to any purpoſe at all, and for his peoples edification. Well now then, if any Licenſed perſon ſhall gather their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56450:13"/>in a way of oppoſition to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Churches, which he hath alſo eſtabliſht, by denial of them to be true Churches, I do account ſtill that all ſuch partaking thereby with the <hi>Novatian</hi> and the <hi>Donatiſt</hi> of old, muſt come under the condemnation of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Councels paſſed upon their error, and that is that which <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> we call Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. If any again ſhall gather a people in a way of ſtrife, pride, vain-glory, envy, contention, which are breaches of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, when the end of the Commandment is Charity, I will account this alſo being ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, it does make thoſe conventions Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical. But if a man ſhall come honeſtly and peaceably in the fear of God with prudence and innocency, as becomes a Chriſtian, to ſet up one of theſe Meetings by vertue of the ſame Authority as the Pariſh Prieſt hath his: I will deſire any that can, to ſhew me now, where the ſin is to be found. If he can ſhew it me I will conſent to him, that he ſhall call all theſe Meetings Schiſmatical ſtill, upon condition that if he cannot, he will pardon them henceforth who do go to theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches (by the Kings appointment now <hi>parts</hi> of the National) with the ſame veneration and regard as to the Pariſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. We will thank the late ingenuous
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56450:14"/>Author, who adviſed us to take heed that <hi>Toleration be not abuſed,</hi> and we do ſhew wherein that care is to be taken, that we may not abuſe it: but when he would have had the Non-Conformiſt under pretence of not abuſing his liberty, to take ſuch a courſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as not to uſe it at all (though the generality of us do judge they ſhould moſt glorifie God this way) he deſerved to be blamed; who upon the conviction, will perhaps as ſoon as any, be ready to thank God with us, if a door ſo effectual be opened, then we may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence, and without Schiſm, joyn our ſtrength in a mutual love and concord for the carrying on the great work of mans Salvation throughout the Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But are not theſe Presbyterians very Knaves, who ſtood before on</hi> Chriſts <hi>Authority for their Preaching, and now take Licenſes of the</hi> King? <hi>While their plea was the ſame with the Apoſtles, that they ought to obey God rather then Man, we could bear with them; but now we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver abide them more.</hi> I pray Sirs, good words! As <hi>Charity</hi> always thinketh the beſt, I ſee this <hi>all will</hi> ſtill thinketh nothing but evil. If it were the duty of the Non-Conformiſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to Preach before his Majeſties <hi>Declaration,</hi> it muſt be his duty ſtill: and if when we have obtained ſuch grace as this is, the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56450:14"/>ſhould not accept it, (when there is no more doubt of prejudicing our Miniſtry thereby, then the Apoſtles did theirs, when they had <hi>leave</hi> of the Maſters of the Synago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues to <hi>ſay on</hi>), who would have fallen on the whole party ſo foully for refractory and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe fellows, as theſe men? It is true, we look on Chriſts Commiſſion to be enough for our Preaching when we judge it for Gods Glory; but to Preach <hi>in ſuch a place,</hi> and in ſuch circumſtances, is, we count in the diſpoſe of the Magiſtrate. The Magiſtrate hath the power <hi>of external order,</hi> and may forbid a man to <hi>Preach,</hi> I ſay <hi>in ſuch a place,</hi> when he cannot forbid him to <hi>Preach;</hi> or elſe our Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits were our own ſtill, for all the Act of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity. The Presbyterians take Licenſes of the King in reference to the <hi>place</hi> of their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies. Nay this authority of the King in ſlating theſe places and Meetings for them, does incorporate them as <hi>integral parts,</hi> or particular fellow congregations with thoſe of the Parochial conſtitution, into the <hi>Church National,</hi> united under him as the Supreme Head: which is a matter of that great weight and conſequence, as we have not yet looked about us, to bleſs God enough for it. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by can the Non-Conformiſt make his publick acknowledgement (which he would have) of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56450:15"/>the Kings Supremacy in Eccleſiasticals no leſs then the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and yet his conſcience not be burdened with the <hi>Dioceſan.</hi> Truely I know not but his Majeſty really hath diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more for the hitting the buſineſs of coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating his whole people into one Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal National ſociety or body under him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, then any of us were a warre of, who could not ſee before any reaſon for ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings as are taken in this Declaration, which we ſhall approve henceforth with a great deal of ſatisfaction. <hi>But did not theſe men in the late Wars take part with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and now they ſubmit to the Kings De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration againſt an Act of Parliament?</hi> Be it ſo. The Act of Parliament is againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God: The King permits what God bids. Who ſhould the ſubject obey, but God and the King? As for the <hi>War,</hi> I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it will ſtill be ript up though againſt the <hi>Act of Oblivion.</hi> It was not upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Religion (it muſt be firſt known) that it will be owned. In the cauſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion if we be perſecuted, we may <hi>fly,</hi> Chriſt allows us, but we may not <hi>reſiſt.</hi> The caſe then I account a ſingular caſe. <hi>It was upon the Militia they began,</hi> the old King ſaid. The King and Parliament was divided that is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and the queſtion was, where the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56450:15"/>(or the moſt of it) did lye? ſome thought in the <hi>one,</hi> ſome in the <hi>other,</hi> and ſo were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged. I will ſpeak now once for all, that the mouths of theſe men may be ſtopped with reaſon, for nothing elſe will do it. There are ſome have thought thus. The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Nation is <hi>mixt.</hi> A mixt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is where the ſupreme Authority is not placed <hi>purely</hi> in the <hi>People,</hi> or the <hi>Nobles,</hi> or the <hi>Monarch,</hi> but <hi>mixtly</hi> in them <hi>all.</hi> The ſupreame Legiſlative power in this Nation lies in the King and his two Houſes <hi>joyntly,</hi> not <hi>ſeverally,</hi> as <hi>one Corporation</hi> (ſays Judge <hi>Jenkins</hi>) or to ſpeak ſurely, as <hi>one Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> The Parliament which is to be <hi>one in Law</hi> being divided, the conſtitution is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that being broken, the Government is diſſolved, and the power returned at that ſeaſon to the people. The people being at liberty, many men of ſober ſpirits thought themſelves bound to go that way, which would moſt tend to the advancement of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And this is the true ſtate of their cauſe, which, though I my ſelf in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for my univerſity Oaths ſake was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe inclined, I do humbly offer, in Juſtice, for their Apology. Onely I muſt add this, that the occaſion which happened once, that was the Kings own depoſing his power of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56450:16"/>the Parliament at that time, being like never to be again, there is no hurt at all in it. If after this, theſe men will yet preſs us further; I will return that the ſtate of the caſe being quite altered, the King brought in again, and with univerſal conſent, into the old conſtitution, here is a wonderful kind of thing fallen out, that the <hi>Fanatick,</hi> or <hi>Anti-Epiſcopial</hi> party of the Nation, are really turning to be the <hi>Royaliſt,</hi> who are for <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, &amp; Supremacy</hi> in Eccleſiaſticals, when the Biſhops party who have made it hitherto a proverb that <hi>without them no King,</hi> are the men bandy againſt it, for the maintenance of theſe Acts of Parliament. And thus much ſhall ſuffice as to the firſt thing offered by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facer about Popery and the Kings Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>I come then now to the other thing that requires our notice, which is a matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of great moment, and therefore intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by me for the main task of my preſent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, and that is his aſſerting <hi>an authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Magiſtrate over the conſcience of his Subjects in matters of Religion.</hi> So he hath expreſſed it, and made it the ſubject of two other Books, and inſiſts upon it ſtill in this
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56450:16"/>
                  <hi>Preface.</hi> I am willing therefore to enter into a diſſertation with him about the point: for it will be worthy not only of our two la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, but of another learned, pious, ſtudious and worthy Knight, who was the Author of the Papers entituled, <hi>Liberty of Conſcience;</hi> and whom I ſhall purpoſely engage with the <hi>Prefacer,</hi> that, if it be poſſible, we may all three together (will we, nill we) beat out the right determination of the buſineſs.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Prefacer,</hi> I muſt needs ſay, that I take him to be a man of fewer years and quicker parts, and of a more flouriſhing Pen than to be fit, at leaſt of himſelf, for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking any ſuch point as this is. For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man muſt be of a patient complexion that can read over all that is written by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers about the ſubject, and then give us the <hi>Compendium,</hi> according to his judgment: or he muſt be able, by fixing long upon one thing, and inculcating the thoughts of it upon the mind, to frame his own notion, in ſuch a fore-caſting of it through the whole train of its conſequences to the end, as to make it hold together, which is not the work <hi>unius Diei,</hi> or <hi>unius liturae,</hi> to uſe the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Biſhop offer'd to my hand. I know that the happineſs of the firſt conceit does much, but it is not the nimbleneſs of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56450:17"/>Pen, and a torrent of words, does the reſt. Nay rather, it is this volubility of the tongue which is Truth's great Harlot, while the handſomneſs of the expreſſion will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſtill to allure away the judgment from that cloſer attendance to the <hi>dry notion,</hi> that <hi>Controverſal points,</hi> or <hi>Caſes of Conſcience,</hi> do require; which ſhould not therefore be writ in the ſtyle of this age. For the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage particularly of this perſon, I cannot but compare methinks to a like preſent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion in the Garments of Women, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity of whoſe dimenſions may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps make their bodies look more ſtately, but it will trip their heels up, beſides the cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſomneſs, if they take not heed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or ſome other come after to keep them from falling. Well! the buſineſs this notable eloquent Gentleman hath to do in this <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi> is, for ought I ſee really, only to abuſe the <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> and ſo faſten upon them ſome charge if he could tell what, &amp; againſt whom in reference to their loyalty or duty to the Government. But the charge being founded at the bottom only upon his firſt Book, or the cauſe he hath there managed, the beſt way to anſwer all his <hi>parti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ulars,</hi> wil be to let them quite alone, without raking the Dunghill up, and to touch only in <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> upon the foundation.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:56450:17"/>
               <p>There are two paſſages then I will cite out of this <hi>Preface,</hi> for there are no more I count of that nature, which I make my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. <hi>All their exceptions relate either to the Power in it ſelf, or to the matters of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. The firſt are directly levell'd againſt the very being of Authority; and Magiſtrates, of what kind ſoever, according to their general pretences, muſt not dare to put any reſtraint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſubjects conſciences, leſt they invade the Divine Prerogative, overthrow the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental liberties of human nature, and undo honeſt men for their loyalty to God and their Religion. Now if this right be claimed without limitation, then the conſequence is unavoidable, That ſubjects may, when ever they pleaſe, croſs with the authority of their Governours, upon any pretence that can wear the name of Religion. But this being groſly abſurd, the neceſſity of a Soveraign power in matters of Religion, is granted, and all Arguments that prove it in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral neceſſary to Peace and Government, are allowed, or at leaſt are not contradicted: for what ever admits an Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever bounded and limited, admits it; and that is enough to the firſt aſſertion of a ſupream Authority over the Conſcience in matters of Religion.</hi> Again, after eighteen pages far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>And they are exhorted above all things
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56450:18"/>to keep their Conſciences</hi> (i.e. <hi>themſelves</hi>) <hi>free from the uſurpation of all human Laws, that is, in effect, they are forbidden to make any conſcience of ſubjection to Princes: for it is only Conſcience that is capable of the obligation of Laws, ſo that if they be exempt, the whole man is at liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By theſe two paſſages it does appear to me, that this <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Politician</hi> from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his ſetting out to the end, does run all along in that confuſion, as it will be hard to bring him to ſorts. But it ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice me to offer two diſtinctions, which alone as I hope may ſerve to do this work, both of drawing him out of his darkneſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing others thereby of the injury of his accuſations. Diſtinguiſh we then firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Authority of the Magiſtrate over his Subjects in <hi>matters of Religion,</hi> and an Authority <hi>over the Conſcience</hi> in any matters whatſoever. It is manifeſt in the very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his Title, and the cuſtomary lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of his firſt Book, and of this <hi>Preface,</hi> That he does confound <hi>Conſcience</hi> with the <hi>Matters of Religion;</hi> whereas there are mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion wherein the <hi>Conſcience</hi> may not be concerned, and matters wherein the Conſcience may be concerned, &amp; they be no <hi>Eccleſiaſtical matters.</hi> The ſecond diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56450:18"/>then is, between <hi>Subjection,</hi> which refers to the Authority reſiding in the Magiſtrate himſelf, and which is our duty in oppoſition to <hi>reſiſtance</hi> or rebellion; and <hi>Obedience</hi> which lyes in the doing what he commands. It is apparent in the laſt paſſage how he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds theſe two things, when the <hi>making conſcience of ſubjection to Princes,</hi> and <hi>obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Law,</hi> is belike all one with him in his preſent conception. But that there is a difference to be put between theſe two, it does appear undeniably from one conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we are always bound in conſcience to the <hi>one,</hi> that is <hi>ſubjection:</hi> but we are not always ſo bound to the <hi>other,</hi> to <hi>obedience.</hi> The things that are commanded may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſinful, or hurtful to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and then it will be our duty not to obey them: or they may be idle, vain, frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, which we may chooſe therefore to do out of prudence, for fear of wrath, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void contempt and ſcandal, when we are not otherwiſe to hold our ſelves bound in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>To begin with the former. <hi>By me Kings Reign,</hi> ſays Wiſdom, and if they rule <hi>by</hi> God, it is fit they ſhould alſo rule <hi>for</hi> him. <hi>He is the Miniſter of God for our good,</hi> ſays the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. The Miniſter is to look to his Lords will, and the good of the Subject is not only their <hi>Temporal</hi> but <hi>Spiritual</hi> good. And if he be Gods Miniſter for our good, there can be no exemption of <hi>Sacred things</hi> any more then <hi>Civils</hi> from his Authority, under God, for the good of his People. And hence are we taught to pray for Magiſtrates, that we may lead peaceable lives under them in all <hi>Godlineſs</hi> as well as <hi>Honeſty.</hi> Kings and Emperors (ſays <hi>Grotius</hi> from ſome other) are equally to take care of Sacred and Secular things: but onely when we come to particulars, it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that the <hi>jus imperii</hi> is more narrow in matters of Religion, then in other matters upon this one account, that the Divine Law does appoint or determine more things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Religion, and ſo takes them out of the Magiſtrates liberty, then it does concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other matters. <hi>In hoc Reges ſicut cis Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitus praecipitur Deo ſerviunt in quantum Reges ſunt, ſi in ſuo regno bona jubeant, mala
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56450:19"/>prohibeant: non ſolum quae pertinent ad huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam ſicietatem, verum etiam quae ad Divinam Religionem,</hi> ſays Auguſtine, <hi>Contra Creſco nium, l.</hi> 3. <hi>c,</hi> 51. The affairs of Religion I muſt ſay again are of the greateſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and it is not fit Gods Miniſter ſhould neglect his greater affairs, to take care only of the leſs. Beſides there are no matters in the Earth which have ſo great an influence on Mens ſpirits to put them in agitation, as the matters of Religion: and if they were exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wholy from the authority of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Governour, it would be a very hard thing for any mortal to govern at all. The Non-Conformiſts therefore deny not the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the King in matters Eccleſiaſtical. No, they may perhaps be rather accuſed ſhortly for acknowledging it too much, (as hath been intimated) ſeeing they do accept of his <hi>Declaration,</hi> nor do they ſcruple his Title of Supreame Head. We diſtinguiſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed between a <hi>Civil</hi> head of the Church and the <hi>Conſtitutive</hi> head. The King we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the civil Head or Governour of the Church of <hi>England</hi> as well as the <hi>State,</hi> that is in whom the only <hi>Supream Coercive</hi> authority does lye over all perſons in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> as well as <hi>other</hi> matters. But as to the <hi>conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> head of our Church as an Eccleſiaſtical
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56450:20"/>organical body, it will be hard for thoſe who own not be Biſhops <hi>jure Divino,</hi> to aſſign. The National Church hitherto I took to be the Integrum of our Parochial Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the Paſtors of all the Pariſh Churches in <hi>England virtually</hi> aſſociated (for they are not <hi>actually</hi>) are I think the conſtitutive head of the Church of <hi>England</hi> under Chriſt, in that <hi>external formal Government</hi> of it, he hath committed to them. There is the <hi>internal</hi> Government of the Church, which belongs only to Chriſt and his Spirit, who alone can rule mens hearts: or the <hi>external</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. This external regiment is either <hi>formal</hi> which belongs to the Miniſters: or <hi>Objective,</hi> which belongs to the Magiſtrate. The <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> cannot therefore by vertue of his Office enter into the function of the <hi>Prieſt</hi> to do his work, though he can make the Miniſter himſelf do it, and puniſh him if he neglect his duty. He can give a call to the Paſtoral Rulers to meet and frame Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical conſtitutions; and when himſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make them, they ſhall not yet be obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to the ſubject, unleſs they have his San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. This external authority over the Church, which is <hi>Objective</hi> (that is, which is converſant about Eccleſiaſtical affairs, but does not exerciſe them, which is <hi>Circa Sacra</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:56450:20"/>not <hi>in Sacris,</hi> according to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> of old, <hi>Epiſcopus</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) does differ from the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> (which is from Chriſt to us as his Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards and Embaſſadors, and ſo to be put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution no otherwiſe then as it is preſcribed by him in the word) in this mainly, that the one is <hi>Declarative,</hi> that can <hi>direct</hi> what is Gods will, and <hi>perſwade</hi> to it, and threaten only with reference to another world; but the other is a power to <hi>make that our duty,</hi> which it requires, and <hi>enforce</hi> it to be done by preſent puniſhments, that is, a power which is <hi>juris Conſtitutinum</hi> and <hi>Coercive.</hi> There are two ſorts then of things, which are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Magiſtrates Power or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Things or actions <hi>determined</hi> by God himſelf in his word: or things that are leſs <hi>undetermined</hi> by him, as neither commanded nor forbidden. For the former, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates power does lye in his being made the <hi>Keeper of the Tables,</hi> having no authority to change a title of Gods Law; ſo that his work in reſpect of ſuch things conſiſts in <hi>protecting</hi> thoſe that obſerve them, and <hi>encouraging</hi> ſuch by <hi>removing</hi> what will <hi>hinder,</hi> and <hi>promoting</hi> what will <hi>further</hi> them in their duty: as alſo in his <hi>diſcouraging</hi> the Tranſgreſſour, by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing the occaſions of their ſin, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them for it. For the latter, the power of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56450:21"/>the Magiſtrate does lye in his liberty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine all ſuch things as being before not determined, ſo as by that determination to make them our duty which were indifferent before; to make it our duty, I ſay, to <hi>avoid,</hi> or <hi>do</hi> ſuch things according as he <hi>requires</hi> or <hi>prohibits</hi> them for the common edification. <hi>Haes ſive Sacra ſive profana ſint</hi> (ſays <hi>Grotius</hi>) <hi>determinare in alterum partem jus eſt ſummae poteſtatis.</hi> Provided always that ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands as theſe do indeed anſwer that end; For ſeeing power in the original, is derived from God as Supreame Lord; [<hi>Thou couldſt have no power,</hi> ſays, Chriſt to <hi>Pilate, unleſs it were given thee of God</hi>]: and it is given of God to none but for the <hi>common good,</hi> we are to conceive that the things that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in <hi>Civils</hi> are for the good of the Common-wealth, and in <hi>Eccleſiaſticals</hi> for our Spiritual edification, or elſe though they muſt be done, rather then we reſiſt or ſuffer, they do not bind us in our <hi>conſciences.</hi> The <hi>will of God</hi> that ſuch a one ſhould command, is I ſay, <hi>power</hi> in the root. This <hi>will</hi> is that he command nothing but for our edification, or the common good, <hi>[According to the power given us of God for edification]:</hi> If his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand then be not indeed ſuch, it is deſtitute of Gods authority, and becoming thereby a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56450:21"/>command in <hi>foro alieno</hi> (that is in <hi>foro exterio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi> onely), and in <hi>aliena materia,</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience (whoſe <hi>adaequate</hi> rule the will of God only is) muſt be left to its liberty. <hi>The Body indeed is bound</hi> (ſays Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi>), <hi>and we must ſuffer patiently the evil which we cannot deprecate: but Laws that are made to purpoſes beyond theſe meaſures do no ways oblige the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. He is the Miniſter of God for good, ſays St.</hi> Paul, <hi>otherwiſe he is not Gods Miniſter, and hath to other purpoſes none of Gods authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therefore cannot oblige the conſcience to an active obedience, in ſuch where the power is incompetent to command. Duc. Dub. B.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>r.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Having then granted and ſtated one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the diſtinction, I muſt come to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is, that though the Magiſtrate hath an authority over his Subjects, in the matters of Religion as well as civil matters, yet hath he no authority for all that <hi>over the conſcience</hi> of any. Conſcience is the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a man concerning himſelf and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with reference to the Judgement of God. It is a faculty whereby we diſcern what is Gods Judgement of us and our actions, and there is no man muſt do any thing contrary to that judgement. If the Magiſtrate then have power <hi>over the conſcience,</hi> in any thing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56450:22"/>whatſoever, he muſt have power, either to make us change our judgement of that thing, and judge otherwiſe: or elſe though we judge thus, to do otherwiſe then that judgement; that is though we judge that it is Gods will we ſhould do thus, the command of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate ſhall make it lawful for us to do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwiſe. The firſt of theſe is againſt reaſon, there is no man can make <hi>himſelf,</hi> to judge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe of a thing in good earneſt then he does judge: and it cannot then be in the power of the Magiſtrate to make him do it, any more then it is in his power to make him fly in the Air, or live under water. This is ſo manifeſt, that this ingenious Author hath ſpoken enough of it himſelf in his firſt Book. The latter is againſt Piety, for to do the thing which I judge to be the will of God I ſhould not do, becauſe the Magiſtrate does com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it, is manifeſtly a preferring the <hi>will</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> before <hi>Gods,</hi> that is, an <hi>having of other Gods before him,</hi> which is the ſin of the firſt Commandment. The truth is, to go about the making of the <hi>Magiſtrates will</hi> to be the <hi>rule of conſcience</hi> in any thing, let it be what it will, is manifeſtly to defloure conſcience, to make that which is <hi>peculiar</hi> to God to be <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> with man, or <hi>profane.</hi> For <hi>con-ſcientia</hi> importing in the very word and thing, the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56450:22"/>judgement of God together with ours, it muſt be <hi>his will,</hi> and that alone muſt be the <hi>rule</hi> of it, and if any thing elſe be once made its rule, it is gone. If the Magiſtrate have an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the conſcience in any thing, the reaſon will be the ſame for all. I mean, if I may do any thing which I judge contrary to Gods will (which judgement I ſay is my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience), then cannot that be a reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain me in another. The reaſon why I dare not commit Adultery, or do the like hainous crime, is becauſe it is againſt my conſcience, and if that reaſon be rendred inſufficient, that a thing may be done, though it be againſt a mans conſcience, there is an end of Religion. If the Magiſtrate have an authority over the conſcience, then muſt the internal acts of men be ſubject to his Government, when it is God only that knows, and can rule the <hi>heart:</hi> But <hi>Grotius</hi> hath taught us well here. There are <hi>internal</hi> acts of men, and the <hi>external.</hi> Thoſe acts of men (ſays he) which do <hi>ſubia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere humano imperio</hi> are his external acts only: and our internal acts can be commanded no further then they are concerned in the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. The inward acts of mans <hi>ſoul</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and much leſs his <hi>conſcience</hi> are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his <hi>cognizance,</hi> and ſo not under his juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. If the Magiſtrate hath power over
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56450:23"/>the conſcience, then good and evil ſhould be founded in <hi>jure poſitivo,</hi> and not in <hi>jure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae:</hi> Then might he impoſe on us a new Faith, nor new Articles in our Creed: Then muſt we have no Religion but his <hi>Will,</hi> and no God but <hi>Leniathan</hi> only. It is true that when the Magiſtrate commands me any thing for my good, or for the common good though to my loſs, that thing is now become my duty; and as I know it is Gods <hi>will</hi> that I ſhould obey ſuch commands, I am obliged in conſcience: and if this very nimble Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, will but be contented with this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, and declare that by the Magiſtrates authority over the conſcience, he intends not either that he hath power to force the <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or the <hi>action</hi> againſt the judgement (when upon the laſt indeed it is he does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench), I may deſcend to the other diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

               <p>The ſecond diſtinction then, that muſt bring ſome <hi>light</hi> to this young Doctors un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, if he be not yet too old to learn, and <hi>confutation</hi> to his charge, which he ſo fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volouſly without any cauſe, &amp; to no purpoſe, does advance againſt he knows not whom, may
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56450:23"/>appear with conviction upon himſelf from theſe words, ſpeaking of the Non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts exceptions, <hi>which relate</hi> (ſays he) <hi>either to the Power it ſelf, or the matters of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</hi> If then he diſtinguiſhes well, the <hi>power</hi> it ſelf and it <hi>commands,</hi> the duty or obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ariſes upon the ſubject, in reference to theſe which are two, muſt be diſtinct like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. The force of it cannot be avoided, let him ſeem never ſo much to neglect it. He is pleaſed indeed, to ſay that we <hi>exhort</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>in effect to make no conſcience of ſubjection to Princes,</hi> becauſe we ſay that they are not always bound in conſcience to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; that is becauſe we do inſtruct them ſo about the obligation of human Laws, as they may know they are not to make the <hi>will</hi> of the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> but the will of <hi>God</hi> alone, to be the rule of the Conſcience. We do therefore here inſtruct them right, and that which this man would have, were to pervert them. He does diſcover plainly his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of this diſtinction, and this diſtinction the vanity of his accuſation. We are always bound in conſcience to <hi>ſubjection</hi> unto the Powers that are, we acknowledge this, this, we Preach it, we Print it, and are ready to maintain it: but we are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways bound in conſcience to <hi>Obedience:</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:56450:24"/>And God forbid that we ſhould. If he could have diſtinguiſhed theſe two things, he might have ſpared moſt of his labour. There is a Book entituled, <hi>The Obligation of human Laws diſcuſſed,</hi> which I Printed a year ſince; I muſt deſire my Reader to get it (and bind it together if he can with this), for they are of two ſubjects that do enterfare very much; <hi>The authority of the Magiſtrate in the matters of God diſcuſſed,</hi> was the entended Title of this, but I could not Print it till this Preface now hath given me the occaſion. I uſe the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Scripture <hi>in the matters of God,</hi> becauſe I would include all matters wherein the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is concerned, as well as Eccleſiaſtical matters. Now I have in that Book laid down this diſtinction with one more, as the ground work of my determination of that point, and I have need to ſay a little more to prevent ſome cavil, which may be raiſed by this perſon upon my reproof, which I muſt alſo give him for the next words he uſes, <hi>viz. 'Tis conſcience onely</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that is capable of the Obligation of human Laws, ſo that if that be exempt, the whole man is at liberty.</hi> I wonder at the Man for this; I do hate this pride me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks for being <hi>indocible</hi> and <hi>perverſe</hi> no leſs then for being <hi>ugly.</hi> Pride is an overweening conceit of ones ſelf with the contempt of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56450:24"/>There is nothing more viſible than this filthy pride in this young man, and that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor who wrote the <hi>Friendly Debate,</hi> but only with this difference, that I judg this the more ingenuous or open, the other the more can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kered and ſly; I pray God forgive them both with all my heart. It is a baſe piece of immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality I am ſure in either, that when they have to do with any ſuch perſon as Dr <hi>Owen,</hi> of years ſo much elder than themſelves, and who are not without ſome reputation at leaſt with other perſons, to uſe ſuch contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſdainful ſcorning language as they do altogether, which ariſing ſo manifeſtly too from the conceit and confidence alone they have of themſelves, does declare them two ſuch <hi>Sons of the morning,</hi> ſuch a couple of proud Deſpiſers, that until they do ſhew ſome repentance and <hi>acknowledgment</hi> for their fault, they do deſerve really to be excommunicated out of the good thoughts of all men, that moſt deſervedly otherwiſe do honor them never ſo much. Well! This man cannot it ſeems underſtand how he ſhould be obliged <hi>at all,</hi> unleſs he be obliged <hi>in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> He cannot diſcern belike between an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation <hi>ſimpliciter,</hi> &amp; the obligation of <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> He cannot diſcern that the <hi>conſcience</hi> which judges of our duty only in relation to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56450:25"/>
                  <hi>God</hi> is bound only by a <hi>Divine obligation,</hi> and that a <hi>Divine obligation</hi> may be diſtinguiſhed from an <hi>Human obligation.</hi> Is it not indeed ſtrange that a man of ſuch quick parts, hath yet ſo little ſolid judgment? Is it not one thing (thinks he) to be bound to an action, becauſe it is Gods will, and for fear of Hell, or Divine puniſhments: and another to be bound to it out of fear only of the Law, and to eſcape ſuffering? Does not the Apoſtle, when he tells us, <hi>We muſt be ſubject not only for wrath, but alſo for Conſcience ſake,</hi> imply this diſtinction, that there is an obligation then only for <hi>wrath</hi> ſake, and an obligation out of <hi>conſcience?</hi> And cannot this exceeding fine witted man by any means diſcern this? And will not he nor the <hi>Debater</hi> learn, though it be never ſo ingenuous for them to come here to ſome acknowledgment, that themſelves as well as others may be able to live in this World under <hi>Laws,</hi> with peace to their ſouls? I do profeſs ſincerely that of all the Books that ever yet I wrot, I am moſt pleaſed in my heart with that Book I now mentioned, as being a ſubject ſo needful for all perſons, though it be the worſt printed. I will ſupply ſome little I want in it in this place. It is this.</p>
               <p>If this Author were a man of as much <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> as <hi>wit,</hi> he would not have laid down
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56450:25"/>himſelf ſo rawly, and excepted at the <hi>thing,</hi> but at the <hi>terms</hi> of the diſtinction which I have uſed with other Divines. For when Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>Bodies</hi> being bound, and I have ſaid the <hi>outward man,</hi> in diſtinction to the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that theſe terms are taken from cuſtom, and that it does fare with them, as it does uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with other School-terms, that they will not ſtrictly hold the examination. The Law of man which binds the ſubject for <hi>wrath ſake</hi> only, does ſo bind him to the external act, as the <hi>will</hi> to that act muſt be included; for to bind him in the <hi>Body</hi> without the <hi>Will</hi> were to put him in Fetters, but it is no <hi>human</hi> obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. This I have ſaid in my Book, and I add here, when I ſay, we diſtinguiſh not the <hi>Will</hi> from the <hi>outward Man,</hi> in the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of human Laws, it muſt be conceived that the will is guided ſtill by the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and is ſuppoſed by ſome to be nothing elſe but the <hi>laſt practical act</hi> of it. I diſtinguiſh not then the <hi>outward</hi> man from the <hi>inward</hi> ſo far as the inward acts are neceſſary to that which is <hi>external,</hi> when I diſtinguiſh <hi>both</hi> from the <hi>conſcience.</hi> There is the <hi>underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (N.B.) that I ſhall <hi>ſuffer</hi> if I do not ſuch a thing, and therefore I <hi>will</hi> do it, is one thing: and the underſtanding that I ſin if I
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56450:26"/>do it not, and therefore I <hi>will</hi> do it, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The one is that our Divines mean by this term of the <hi>outward man</hi> ſtill: and the other is the <hi>conſcience.</hi> You may ask how comes it to paſs that when there goes all this to an act the Magiſtrate commands, ſo that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in his <hi>will</hi> and <hi>underſtanding</hi> (ſo far as to do the thing) is obliged, we do yet call it but the <hi>outward man,</hi> or <hi>forum exterius,</hi> and can diſtinguiſh it with all that, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience? I anſwer, we call this the outward man upon this account, becauſe it is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal acts only that are ſubject to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates Government, or can be required for themſelves, and the acts of the will and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding are not required, but indirectly in relation only to theſe external acts; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay do we well call all this ſtill but the <hi>outward Man:</hi> and this is diſtinguiſhed plainly from the conſcience, becauſe a man may know that ſuch a thing is not required of God, and that God will not puniſh him, though he does not do it, when yet he does know that it is prudent for him rather then ſuffer, and therefore <hi>wills</hi> it. In the one there is the external act with the will and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſo far as that act is concerned: but ſo long as my <hi>underſtanding</hi> is that it is not <hi>Gods will,</hi> but <hi>mans will</hi> that I perform, ſuch a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56450:26"/>thing may be ſaid to be done out of <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> (and <hi>will</hi> as well as by the <hi>outward man</hi>): but not out of <hi>conſcience.</hi> It is not my knowledge of a thing, and that I am to do it: but my knowledge that it is God will, or my knowledge of his judgement of the thing to be the ſame with mine, that makes it <hi>Conſcience.</hi> I think I am full enough now. You may then object, that I ſometimes ſeem in that Book, to make the obligation of the outward man to be <hi>negative,</hi> not to rebell; and another time to be <hi>poſitive</hi> alſo to ſome act. I anſwer, 'tis true that from the beginning, I do make the obligation of the outward man to lye in both theſe, a neceſſity never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and upon that neceſſity to act rather then ſuffer. But intereſt of <hi>fear</hi> or ſelf preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, binds the <hi>reaſon,</hi> as well as the <hi>senſe.</hi> I ſay true, and that there is the <hi>reaſon</hi> then of the <hi>outward man</hi> which is one: and the <hi>reaſon</hi> of the <hi>conſcience,</hi> which is another. When my reaſon is the fear of ſuffering, becauſe I may not reſiſt and therefore I <hi>will,</hi> it is my <hi>outward man</hi> is bound: but when my reaſon is, that the thing hath Gods Authority, and it will offend him if I do it not, and therefore I <hi>will,</hi> then am I bound in <hi>conſcience.</hi> A human Law which is for the common good, binds me from <hi>reaſon of conſcience:</hi> a Law
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56450:27"/>which is unprofitable or againſt it, binds me only from the <hi>outward mans reaſon.</hi> There is Candour indeed to be allowed to this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction (which I have intimated) as to moſt terms of Art, but they are not therefore to be left, both becauſe of their conſtant uſe, and alſo for their profit, in the ſhorter cut which we get to what we would have by the uſe of them. Onely they are verily to be at once firſt throughly underſtood, and then ſhall all that which we ſignifie by them be as compleatly repreſented with a <hi>word,</hi> as if it were drawn out in the <hi>full expreſſion.</hi> That which I have to offer upon this, againſt the <hi>Prefacer</hi> and <hi>Debater</hi> who are companions in this cauſe, is this, that whereas they ſee no more, but to think that the ſtability of <hi>Crowns</hi> and <hi>Scepters,</hi> and ſo of all <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> does lye in the Miniſters, eſpecially the Epiſcopal Divines, preaching ſuch Doctrine as theirs, which is to lay an obligation upon the conſcience of the ſubject to obey them in all things <hi>indefinitely,</hi> unleſs they be <hi>appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently</hi> forbidden in the Word of God, they are exceedingly miſtaken: for if there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to ſupport Soveraignity but that, the Kings Crown might perhaps ſtick no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger on his Head, then till the Parliament ſits again, ſeeing we may then very likely have
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56450:27"/>more <hi>Laws</hi> that we ſhall make no conſcience to obey, and yet we ſhall make conſcience (God willing) of our <hi>Loyalty</hi> to his Majeſty, and muſt do while we live, by the command of the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mighty. It is not the point of <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> then, it muſt be inculcated upon which the Government of Kings is eſtabliſhed: but upon the point of <hi>Subjection.</hi> Let me ſay it over again. It is not on the point of <hi>obedience out of Conſcience:</hi> but on the point that we muſt obey, becauſe the Magiſtrate <hi>beareth the Sword,</hi> and that <hi>not in vain,</hi> that the whole World is kept in Order. And alſo upon this point of Conſcience, that whether we have cauſe to obey or not obey, we muſt however never <hi>reſiſt</hi> upon pain of damnation. Let the Book before mentioned be herein further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted.</p>
               <p>And after this, there will be little reaſon for our <hi>Prefacer</hi> to talk any more of <hi>excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons levelled at the Power it ſelf,</hi> by any <hi>Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of the Non-Conformiſt againſt the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign right of the King in the matters of the <hi>Church</hi> any more then of the <hi>State,</hi> for we own no ſuch, no more then he, though the way of his expreſſing himſelf by <hi>putting a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon his Subjects conſciences,</hi> is ſo feat and grating till it be digeſted, and withal ſo wayward, that I cannot but point it to the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56450:28"/>Readers correction, by what will hereafter follow. If he hath any thing then to charge us with, it muſt be in regard to the <hi>matters of the command,</hi> unto which therefore he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds. <hi>But then they ſay there are ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular things exempted from all humane cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance, which if the Civil Magiſtrate preſume to impoſe upon the conſciences of his Subjects</hi> [He ſhould ſay upon his Subjects, not upon the <hi>conſciences of his Subjects,</hi> for the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate impoſes nothing but upon the outward man, requiring the external act, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acts follow onely ſo far as they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the external], <hi>as he ventures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Warrant of his Commiſſion, ſo he can tye no Obligation of Obedience upon them, ſeeing they can be under no ſubjection in thoſe things, where they are under no Authority. Now this pretence reſolves it ſelf thus, that they do not quarrel his Majeſties Eccleſiaſtical Supremacy, but they acknowledge it to be the undoubted right of all Soveraign Princes, as long as its exerciſe is kept within due bounds of modeſty and moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Which being granted all their general ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions.</hi> [Very fine, when we have indeed none at all!] <hi>againſt the ſufficiency of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority it ſelf are quitted, and they have now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to except againſt, but the exceſs of its Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction. So that having gained this ground,</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:56450:28"/>[Mighty, to gain what never was with held!] <hi>the next thing to be aſſigned and determined, is the juſt and lawful bounds of this Power, which may be ſummed up in this general rule. That Governours take care not to impoſe things appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently evil, and that Subjects be not allowed to plead Conſcience in any other caſe. This is the ſafeſt and moſt eaſie Rule to ſecure the Quiet of all that are upright and peaceable, and all that refuſe ſubjection to ſuch a gentle and moderate Government, make themſelves uncapable of all the benefits of ſociety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is well we are come now at laſt where the water <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>cks. The Non-Conformiſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers not from the Conformiſt in the main point that ſecures all Government that is <hi>Subjection:</hi> but it is in the point of <hi>Obedience</hi> only we differ. And here are two queſtions, The one is about the matters of our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in <hi>general,</hi> what is the rule, or the bounds that muſt be ſet to the Magiſtrates commands, that we exceed not our duty to God, while we are obedient to our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours? The other is about the <hi>particular</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of it, whether the preſent impoſitions of Conformity do keep within that compaſs, and conſequently are lawful or unlawful?</p>
               <p>The latter of theſe is the pitcht Field, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Conformiſt and Non-Conformiſt,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56450:29"/>and neither of us have a mind to enter into it. Only I will offer thus much by the way. The Conformiſts generally do hold that the things we differ about are indifferent, and conſequently thae they may be removed out of the Church by Authority without ſin: The Non-Conformiſts ſay generally they ſhall ſin if they obey them. What then is to be done in the caſe, but if my friend be <hi>weak</hi> and cannot indeed come to me, I muſt go to my friend, if ever I and my friend come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Nay, if he be my friend, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too I muſt do elſe; I muſt part with ſomething, if he need it, and which I can-ſpare, to accommodate him with it; to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate with him by it. I wiſh heartily I might live to ſee a Law, that no man ſhould have any more then one <hi>Cure of ſouls,</hi> ſo long as there are others no leſs able then they, who may take the burden off their hands. It was upon this account, becauſe they wanted men of ability, that <hi>Pluralities</hi> were allowed in the Church at firſt: and when ſuch men do abound, it is wicked to continue them. There is one diſpenſation only ſhould be authentick for a Miniſter that fears God to have <hi>two Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings,</hi> and that is when he hath <hi>two Tongues.</hi> It is this damned hard Argument at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, the Prieſts covetouſneſs and corruption,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56450:29"/>and not their diſpute about the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> that really hinders our Accommodation. I know theſe ſons of the <hi>Horſeleech</hi> will never be contented with a <hi>ſingle portion,</hi> whoſe voice ſtill is <hi>give give:</hi> A <hi>Dignity</hi> therefore with a <hi>Living,</hi> may be allowed to anſwer their dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble give: but <hi>one Dignity,</hi> and <hi>one Cure of Souls</hi> ſhould be all. If there be any will yet cry <hi>give, give, and give,</hi> they may be the ſons of the <hi>Aſpe,</hi> or the <hi>Adder,</hi> for the Horſeleech her ſelf muſt ſay ſhe never had any ſuch ſons as theſe, <hi>who enlarge their deſire as Hell, and are as Death, and cannot be ſatisfied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former is the queſtion to which we muſt return, and we are indeed beholding to the Gentleman, for compriſing his Books into the <hi>Compendium</hi> of this Rule. <hi>The Governour muſt not impoſe things apparently evil: and the Subject muſt be allowed to plead Conſcience in no other caſe.</hi> For the examination of this poſition, I will ask in the firſt place who ſhall be Judge, whether a thing be <hi>apparently evil</hi> or not? The Magiſtrate judges it good, the Subject holds it notoriouſly evil. Shall the Subject take upon him now to controul the judgement of his Soveraign, and tell him that is evil which he calls good? <hi>Who ſhall ſay to his Prince, Thou art wicked?</hi> I am not ſure what he will firſt ſay to this. In the next
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56450:30"/>place, ſuppoſe a thing not to be <hi>apparently</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, but thought indifferent by the Prince and his Subjects generally, and yet ſome perſon hath his reaſons upon deep conſideration that prove it evil. He is convinced in his own conſcience upon theſe reaſons. What will this Author judge now in this caſe? muſt he indeed forſake his <hi>own judgment and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and acquieſce in the determination of his Governour?</hi> I know this Author ſpeaks after this rate in his firſt Book: but I am out of doubt that he may never forſake his <hi>conſcience</hi> (which is that preſent judgement) for any fear, command, or advantage in the World. Again, ſuppoſe a thing be really indifferent in its nature, and it is ſo to me in my <hi>Abſolute</hi> judgement: yet there are caſes in regard of the circumſtances or accidents, that make it in my <hi>Hypothetical</hi> judgement to be ſinful, what will he have us to do now? For inſtance, There are things to me indifferent, which yet are hainous in others, and I may ſcandalize them in my doing them by my example. It was indifferent to the ſtrong Chriſtian to eat of meats offered to Idols, who knew that an Idol was nothing, but to him that made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the Idol, it was Idolatry: now for a man to whom this thing was lawful, to eat before him to whom it was Idolatry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56450:30"/>unlawful, and he may not do it for conſcience ſake: <hi>Conſcience I ſay, not thy own, but of that other.</hi> God commands, thou ſhalt not do that thing, whereby thy ſelf or others will be lead to ſin if it be done. The Magiſtrate commands thou ſhalt do ſuch a thing: Who muſt be obeyed <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man?</hi> When a thing is evil by <hi>accident,</hi> and not <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecally</hi> evil, if we can ſeperate the <hi>accident</hi> from the <hi>thing,</hi> we muſt do it: But if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not remove if from the accident, that acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent makes it evil, and we cannot be obliged unto ſin, by the commandment of man. In the laſt place, And why <hi>muſt a man be allowed conſcience in no other caſe?</hi> is it becauſe he hath, or is to have no conſcience in any caſes but ſuch? Does not the Apoſtle require of every one in the caſe of indifferent things, that they be <hi>perſwaded fully in their own minds,</hi> that they act not but in <hi>Faith?</hi> Does he not tell us that if they <hi>eat</hi> before they are ſo perſwaded they are <hi>damned,</hi> and that <hi>to him who eſteemeth the thing unclean, it is unclean?</hi> Does not the Apoſtle ſpeak directly and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely about things here that are not <hi>intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecally</hi> and <hi>apparently</hi> evil, but matters of that nature, which are good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, according to the diverſities of mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions? How bold is this man then to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56450:31"/>us ſuch a rule, which is directly to lead us if we follow it, againſt theſe plain Texts of Scripture, upon the hazard of damnation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The juſt and lawful bounds</hi> (ſays he) <hi>of this power, have been already deſcribed</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> in his former Books) <hi>as to the moſt material caſes that can occurre in human life, which may be ſummed up in this general Rule,</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. If this Rule then be the ſum of what he hath offered in his former Books, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that he being out in this rule, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Books muſt fall with it. But if this then be not the <hi>rule,</hi> you may ask what is? It is eaſie to <hi>throw down,</hi> but the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is to <hi>build.</hi> I anſwer, it is this is the work and buſineſs of my diſcourſe that enſues, and to be preſented beſt by degrees upon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of what is offered alſo by <hi>another:</hi> yet ſeeing the Gentleman hath engaged me with this <hi>ſum</hi> of his thoughts (which is I count in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly done, though he be out), I will requite him with the like, though I do ſome thing prevent my own intentions. I ſay then that this Author is ſo far miſtaken in propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this rule to the Magiſtrates <hi>power over mens conſciences,</hi> that it is <hi>Conſcience it ſelf is the Rule,</hi> even the conſcience which is in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular ſubject, is the <hi>bounds</hi> and <hi>rule</hi> to him of what he muſt, and muſt not do,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56450:31"/>(how far and no farther he muſt go), in all the commands of <hi>Man</hi> whatſoever. One would wonder to ſee what obſcurity is caſt upon Truth by words and Diſputes. There are no Divines but will tell us that it is the will of God, or the Word of God that is the <hi>rule</hi> of conſcience and the <hi>adaequate</hi> rule of it, as Dr <hi>Sanderſon</hi> upon this ſubject; That it is Gods <hi>Seat,</hi> with the like expreſſions. And what is the meaning of this, but that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is not, and cannot be under any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that is human, but is ſubject to God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? and yet when we come to this point, and ask how far the Magiſtrates Authority does reach in the matters of Religion, they are not able to ſay, Thus far, as far as Conſcience, even to theſe Confines, and it muſt go no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is Gods Authority muſt be firſt, That of the Conſcience next, and then the Magiſtrates. So long as the Magiſtrates com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands treſpaſs not upon conſcience, they are within his proper Territories, but if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any thing againſt that, they are gone beyond their bounds, and their Authority ceaſes. The truth is, there is but <hi>Gods</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and <hi>Mans</hi> in all, and the conſcience hath Gods Authority, which muſt therefore be over mans. There is no Determination almoſt in any point which hath been held of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56450:32"/>which in the vertical turn is ſo plain, clear, and perfect as this. The Magiſtrate I ſay hath power over his Subject in all things, (N.B.) even in all things whatſoever in the Earth, that <hi>he can do</hi> (as to the <hi>external</hi> acts I have ſaid), and the Subject may, or is to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him in them, ſo far as his conſcience will let him. Lo, here the true rule or bounds of Gods own ſetting in this buſineſs. In ſhort, <hi>The Magiſtrate ſhall command me in any thing, but my conſcience.</hi> And who will not be ready to ſay now that this is indeed that which they knew, and muſt wonder that they themſelves did not make the Determination. Indeed how ſhall a man be ſubject to the Magiſtrate <hi>for conſcience ſake,</hi> if the command of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience had not in it a Superiour and more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent Power than his? it would be for <hi>his own ſake,</hi> and not for <hi>conſcience ſake,</hi> if his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was greater than it. I know I have ſomething here anticipated what is to follow, in giving my notion ſo ſoon, and at once, but I do it for this reaſon, becauſe I know alſo it is the <hi>dry light</hi> at laſt, and that alone, that muſt be of force for conviction of thoſe that will receive any, by controverſie.</p>

               <p>I muſt not yet leave this. There are things in their nature <hi>indifferent:</hi> and things <hi>appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently forbidden</hi> or <hi>required</hi> of God. There is no difference between us in the <hi>laſt,</hi> God muſt be obeyed in ſuch things beyond queſtion. <hi>Duo ſunt genera actuum imperii qui ad jus impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantis non pertinent, Deo vetita jubere, Deo juſſa vetare.</hi> For the other, there is a double caſe, The caſe of <hi>meer indifferency,</hi> and the caſe of <hi>doubt;</hi> That is, there are things which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different in their nature, and appear ſo to us: and there are things indifferent in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and yet appear to us unlawful. In the one caſe, the reſolution is plain. To do a thing whereof I am <hi>in doubt</hi> (that is whereof I am not ſufficiently perſwaded, it is lawful to do) is forbidden. <hi>Whatſoever is not of Faith is ſin.</hi> But the Magiſtrate hath not power to command me to ſin. You may ſay I had better <hi>obey</hi> doubtfully, then <hi>diſobey</hi> doubtfully. I anſwer, my doubt in the one refers unto <hi>God,</hi> in the other unto <hi>Man,</hi> and <hi>I</hi> muſt prefer God before Man. If I <hi>diſobey</hi> I doubt that I do ill onely becauſe of <hi>Mans</hi> command: but if <hi>I obey, I</hi> doubt <hi>I</hi> do ill, becauſe of <hi>Gods. I</hi> muſt be reſolved that God forbids
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56450:33"/>not the thing before the command of man can take place. <hi>I obey</hi> then doubtfully: but <hi>I forbear</hi> in ſaith. <hi>I</hi> believe and am aſſured that God hath not <hi>commanded</hi> the thing <hi>I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear:</hi> but <hi>I</hi> am in doubt whether he hath not <hi>forbidden</hi> what <hi>I obey.</hi> In the other caſe the reſolution in general is, that we are bound to obedience, but it muſt be offered not <hi>indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely,</hi> but with the <hi>diſtinction</hi> of a <hi>Political</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi> Obligation. When <hi>Samuel</hi> tells the people the <hi>manner of their King,</hi> that he would take <hi>their ſons for his Charrets, and Daughters for confectionaries, their Fields and Vineyards to give unto his Servants:</hi> Here is a political obligation on this people to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Children and Eſtates for the Kings uſe upon his command, becauſe the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſuch in the Conſtitution that if he did ſo, they might not reſiſt him for all that: when yet if any of them could ſave their <hi>ſons</hi> and <hi>daughters,</hi> or <hi>goods</hi> without violence, or offending the King, no doubt but they might, and have a good conſcience to God. A <hi>poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> obligation then is to be bound to the thing ſo as to do it rather then reſiſt: a <hi>moral</hi> is to be bound to it ſo, as if we do it not, we ſin: We are bound to obey the King in all his commands of things indifferent with a <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical:</hi> we are not bound to obey them with
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56450:33"/>a <hi>moral</hi> obligation onely when they are for the common good. I have uſed other terms to the ſame ſenſe in my other Book, and I am free in them being explained, but it may be theſe are leſs obnoxious to cavil. The <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Polititian</hi> therefore (and the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bater</hi> both, ſo far as he goes along with him) hath made a very grievous young Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this buſineſs, while he ſo confounded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerts that the Magiſtrate muſt be obeyed in all things <hi>not intrinſecally and aparently evil,</hi> without any diſcrimination elſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever: whereas the holding this, is manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>impious</hi> in <hi>one</hi> of theſe caſes, and <hi>tyrannous</hi> or intolerably oppreſſive to the conſcience in the <hi>other.</hi> There are ſome things indifferent I ſay in their nature, that yet to us are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, while we ſuppoſe them unlawful, or are in doubt of it, and to do them in that doubt is ſin: and there are ſome things law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but ſo inconvenient, ſo unprofitable, ſo grievous, that we ſhould be loath always when then <hi>outward man</hi> is, to have the <hi>conſcience</hi> alſo charged with them.</p>
               <p>I know upon the whole matter, what it is that can mainly be urged. God commands that we honour and obey our Superiours. This is the duty of the fifth Commandment. When the Magiſtrate then does appoint this
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56450:34"/>or that particular thing, an obligation to it ariſes upon us as part of that duty: and ſo the conſcience is obliged by God, and that indefinitely in all Laws. I anſwer, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der who hath read my other Book with this thus far, I will receive this inſtruction as one uſe of the whole, <hi>viz.</hi> how the duty which God requires of us the fifth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be underſtood; and it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood thus: When our Superiour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands what he ought, we are obliged by the Authority of that <hi>particular command,</hi> ſo that if the thing be not done we ſin: when he commands what he ought not, as when a Law is not for the peoples good, we are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged only by the <hi>Authority</hi> which is in his <hi>perſon,</hi> and ſo, if that be preferred otherwiſe, we ſin not though the thing be left undone. And this is but what is ordinarily affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though not ordinarily ſo well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by our Divines, in their ſaying that the commands of men do oblige onely ſo far as to avoid <hi>Contempt</hi> and <hi>Scandal.</hi> A deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination I muſt ſay, to be received onely in ſuch commands, which ought not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: but not in ſuch where the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our commands what he ought. I will expreſs it if you will in other words. When the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour commands any thing which he ought,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56450:34"/>we are obliged <hi>for conſcience ſake,</hi> and the fifth Commandment requires us to do the thing, or elſe we break that command, becauſe this thing bears in it the authority of both <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders:</hi> when he commands any thing which he ought not, we are obliged for <hi>wrath's ſake,</hi> and the fifth Commandment requires only that we do not <hi>reſiſt,</hi> ſo that if we reſiſt not, we give that honour and pay that duty to the Magiſtrate, which we owe in this caſe. If we ſuffer with ſubmiſſion, or obey rather then ſuffer, or avoid both the grievance and ſuffering with prudence, neither bringing contempt on his Authority, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing our Brethren to ſin, we are to account that we anſwer the intent of this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I muſt add ſtill that this is as much too as the Magiſtrate himſelf need deſire in the Earth, ſeeing if he be ſtrict upon it, and the thing be not ſinful, he may take any body do what he pleaſe upon this account.</p>
               <p>As for our Prefacer, it muſt be yet a greater reproof to his undertaking, that in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of his to ſet up an Authority in the Magiſtrate <hi>over the Conſcience</hi> in all matters <hi>External,</hi> he is certainly fallen in with Mr <hi>Hobs,</hi> whom yet to avoid the <hi>odium,</hi> he is fain himſelf to confute. For when that more conſiderable perſon, according to his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56450:35"/>of Government, makes all men by nature before they come into ſociety, to be in a <hi>ſtate of War,</hi> that gives every man right to every thing: which right upon their agreement in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Common-wealth is given up (he counts) into the hands of the Soveraign to determine Propriety, ſo that his <hi>will</hi> thenceforth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the meaſure of <hi>right</hi> and <hi>wrong</hi> to the Community, he proceeds ſo far upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, as to condemn theſe two poſitions. <hi>That every man is judge of good and evil Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. That whatſoever a man does againſt his conſcience is ſin.</hi> See his <hi>Leviathan, C.</hi> 29. Now let us compare this ingenuouſly as we ought (ſeeing elſe it is ſo bad) with other places in his Book. <hi>That Subjects owe to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns ſimple obedience in all things, wherein their obedience is not repugnant to the Laws of God I have proved—C.</hi> 31. Again,<hi>It is manifeſt enough that when a man receiveth two contrary commands, and knows that one of them is Gods, he ought to obey that, and not the other, though it be the command of his lawful Soveraign, or his Father. C.</hi> 43. It does appear then, when the Eccleſiaſtical Polititian does confine the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority he gives the Magiſtrate over the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to <hi>external</hi> and <hi>indifferent</hi> things, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the authority of the conſcience over the Magiſtrates in things <hi>intrinſecally</hi> ſinful,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56450:35"/>and <hi>expreſly forbidden</hi> by God, he does but the ſame which Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> does alſo, if you compare them equally taking one place with another: But herein are they wicked com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions both, that they ſhould once offer to take away from reaſonable Agents, a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>private diſcretion,</hi> in any concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>conſcience</hi> whatſoever.</p>
               <p>One may eaſily indeed perceive what the Contents of this young mans papers do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount unto. He dare not take off all obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of good and evil from mens conſciences antecedent to humane Laws, as <hi>Hobs</hi> in that one place (though otherwhere, as it ſeems, he intended not ſo far) hath done: becauſe this were not only the way to ruine Religion, but his name, and to bring all Government alſo to ruine, which he engages to aſſert. But he would take off all obligations from mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, <hi>in the whole buſineſs of Conformity,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to the will of the Parliament and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, ſo as their Acts muſt be the rule of good and evil to us, as to theſe matters. He does tell us indeed of a liberty to our <hi>Judgments</hi> and to our <hi>Faith:</hi> but when he will allow us to <hi>judge</hi> and <hi>believe</hi> of theſe things as we do, and would yet have us account that the <hi>publick conſcience, the Laws,</hi> and not the <hi>private dictates of our own</hi> muſt govern our <hi>outward</hi> actions, it does
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56450:36"/>bring to my mind one paſſage more in his Friend. <hi>What if a Soveraign forbids his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to believe in Chriſt? I anſwer</hi> (ſays Mr. <hi>Hobs), it is no effect, becauſe belief or unbelief never follow mans Commands. But what if we be commanded to confeſs with our Tongues? It is an external thing, and no more then any other geſture, whereby we ſignifie our obedience, and a Chriſtian holding firmly in his heart the Faith of Christ, hath the ſame liberty herein with</hi> Naaman. <hi>Leviathan. C.</hi> 42. There are no paſſages but this, and that one before cited, that in my reading over that Book, I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be ſo extream bad, as folks ordinarily talk: but this I noted for a Deviliſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, ſeeing it is offered thus indefinitely; for it is directly contrary to all the Holy Martyrs belief and practiſe, and the expreſs inſtitution of our Lord, that he that <hi>confeſſes him before men, he will acknowledge, and he that denieth him, he will deny, before his Heavenly Father:</hi> Yet if any will be ſo kind to the old Gentleman as I have been before, to produce ſome paſſages otherwhere, that may confine h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s meaning here to ſuch compliances of the <hi>Tongue</hi> and <hi>Knee</hi> only, as are required in the impoſitions of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity,</hi> and no other but ſuch, then ſhall the old <hi>Leviathan,</hi> and the young <hi>Leviathan</hi> agree very throughly in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56450:36"/>their opinion. And why the <hi>young</hi> one ſhould fall upon his <hi>Sire</hi> ſo foully as he hath done, whom above all men being alone of his ſide, he ſhould have rather endeavoured to excuſe, unleſs out of <hi>ſhew</hi> onely and for a <hi>coulour,</hi> or out of <hi>invenility</hi> and <hi>vanity,</hi> he ſhall for me have the <hi>Tripos,</hi> or be the eighth man, who can give me a good reaſon.</p>
               <p>I perceive indeed that two points, (and both of which I have had long in my thoughts) are harled together through the skein of this Prefacers Diſcourſe, that is the <hi>Magiſtrates Authority in Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Obligation of human Laws:</hi> It will be expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for me to diſpatch the one quite out of my hands (being already done in another Book) to be at liberty to attend the other preſently altogether. By what hath been then laid down, it may appear that the right and relation of a <hi>Subject</hi> to his <hi>Soveraign</hi> may be held good, when yet there are, it may be, ſome of his Laws not obeyed. Some Laws there are which a man muſt rather ſuffer or dye then obey, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Sacrifice to their Gods: Some we are to obey out of conſcience, ſuch are all the wholeſome Laws of a mans Countrey: Some there are that we obey out of prudence rather then ſuffer, which yet we do not judge our
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56450:37"/>ſelves bound to obey for fear of ſin, or of Gods diſpleaſure. The great queſtion then ariſes what is that <hi>rule,</hi> according to which the Laws of men are to be <hi>meaſured,</hi> that we may know the <hi>kind</hi> and the <hi>degrees</hi> of their obligation. This rule I have advanced in my former Book, and I ſay that, in matters of <hi>Religion</hi> the <hi>Word of God</hi> is the Rule: in <hi>Morals</hi> the <hi>Law of Nature:</hi> in <hi>Politicals</hi> God hath appointed a Rule alſo as ſure, and that is, the <hi>common good.</hi> The Laws of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, as the Sermons of Miniſters, do carry Gods Authority, and oblige the conſciences of the people ſo far, and ſo much, and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or more, then they are <hi>commenſurate</hi> with their <hi>Rule:</hi> in the <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>Word:</hi> in the <hi>other</hi> I ſay of the <hi>common good.</hi> But who ſhall be judge whether a Law be for the good of the publick or no? I have made it my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſpeak to this at large in that Book. Every man muſt have a judgement of private diſcretion, to compare the matters which are enjoyned him with the Rule, in reſpect to his own actions: or elſe he acts as a <hi>Bruite,</hi> or howſoever he acts, he cannot act out of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi> Conſcience lyes in this very point, my knowledge of this or that to have the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God, but no human law hath any authority of his any further then it agrees
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56450:37"/>with his Rule. Note here, I do not reſolve my <hi>obedience,</hi> but my <hi>obedience out of conſcience</hi> into my private judgement whether the Law be, or be not, for the <hi>common good.</hi> And here I muſt ſay no more, becauſe I refer you thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where this is made my proper work: and I find nothing remaine (after what you have here and there), that is wanting in my mind, but the ſatisfying two Objections, as to the main Determination.</p>
               <p>The one of them is this, If the common good be Gods rule in Politicals, then how may any Law which is not for the <hi>common good</hi> be obeyed? We may not obey any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of man againſt Gods rule in <hi>Morality,</hi> and in <hi>Religion.</hi> I anſwer, if a thing be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly againſt the <hi>Common good,</hi> ſo as to be deſtructive to it, we muſt ſuffer rather then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey ſuch a command, for this very reaſon, as we dare not go againſt Gods Word, becauſe it is our rule, and <hi>Gods</hi> rule muſt be obeyed, and not <hi>Mans.</hi> But if a thing be but a little againſt the common good, or no more then that the dammage to the publick by my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying, will not be ſo conſiderable as my own ſuffering, then is it for the common good that I obey rather then ſuffer. And I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve my rule ſtill; For though ſome things in themſelves be againſt the common good,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56450:38"/>yet may my obeying them commanded, be for the common good. And this is to be laid down, and ſuppoſed that in all ordinary and common matters it is better for all in general, or more for the common good to <hi>obey,</hi> then to <hi>reſist</hi> or <hi>ſuffer.</hi> It is for my good, and the common good I will ſuppoſe, that I let the thing alone if I can help it, but if I muſt ſuffer if I do it not, the thing muſt be of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or detriment to the publick, or elſe it is for the good of moſt in general that we obey. It is certainly beſt if a Maſter commands any thing that will hurt the affairs of his Houſe, that it be let alone, if the Boy or Man can eſcape without his anger or beating, and it is better the thing be done that hurts him a little, then that I ſuffer what hurts me more. This is yet moſt certain that a <hi>Coercive power</hi> is the hedge of all <hi>Order</hi> in any <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,</hi> which ſo long as that is kept whole, it is ſafe, and ſo far as that is infringed, and that only, it verges to ruine.</p>
               <p>The other may be offered thus. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good is not the end <hi>alone</hi> of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the honour of the Magiſtrate, and the Glory of God are <hi>ends</hi> alſo, which are ſerved by our obedience, and therefore we are bound in conſcience to the Laws, unleſs they be againſt the Law of God, whether they be
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56450:38"/>for the common good or not. I anſwer, the foundation of this ſuppoſition is upon a great miſtake in Policy, which is that all Societies are formed by <hi>Contract</hi> between the <hi>Governor</hi> and <hi>Governed,</hi> wherein both parties have their intereſts to ſecure, which lays the leven of Civil Wars: Whereas if it be placed in the mutual agreement of the people them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in chooſing their Governour and kind of Government, as they judge beſt for their general advantage, this, ſuppoſing it agreed at firſt to be <hi>abſolute,</hi> ſecures it for ever being ſet up, and anſwers the end of the inſtitution. <hi>He is the Miniſter of God to us for good.</hi> I do not like therefore the making any more then one end of <hi>Polity,</hi> as of <hi>Medicine,</hi> and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.</hi> The <hi>honour</hi> of the <hi>Ruler</hi> is but part of the <hi>bonum commune;</hi> and is to be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it no more then the <hi>wealth</hi> of the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens.</hi> The good of <hi>one</hi> is the good of <hi>both.</hi> And as I like not the making Gods Glory, and Mans Salvation two ends of Divinity, for perplexities that have riſen from thence: ſo do I account that the glorifying God in the common good of the <hi>pars imperans &amp; pars ſubdita,</hi> which both make up the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, to be <hi>one</hi> end of Politicks: and the Glorifying God in mans Salvations to be the one end of Religion. Let every <hi>Art,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56450:39"/>Science,</hi> and <hi>Profeſſion</hi> be diſtinguiſhed by its proper <hi>Object</hi> and <hi>End.</hi> I muſt ſay then after this, the Magiſtrate is honoured in our <hi>ſubjection</hi> always: in <hi>obedience,</hi> when his commands are for the common good, for <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake:</hi> when they are <hi>not,</hi> in our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience onely for <hi>fear,</hi> and rather then <hi>reſiſt:</hi> or in taking heed of any <hi>contempt</hi> or provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of him, if we leave his commands un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. So I conclude, If any receive the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation I have brought him, let him give God the thanks: if any receive it not, the the wrong will be to himſelf, he ſhall do me no hurt.</p>

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56450:39"/>the ſame effect), which I ſhall only name again in my way, (having been too long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with him already) as being in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream on the one hand, while he gives not only a power to the Magiſtrate in the Religious matters, which is well, but a power <hi>over the conſcience in Religious matters:</hi> The other has a perſon of honour, and a worthy Student for its Author, who hath propoſed a ſtate of the queſtion with ſome more mature thoughts, and peculiar notion, which affording me a ground work, for further diſquiſition, hath given me both the <hi>riſe</hi> and <hi>ability</hi> to carry the point on to a full Determination. And this Gentleman I count hath given too little to the Magiſtrate on the other hand in the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion,</hi> but hath gone to make it up with giving him too much in <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> matters. I muſt be forced to tell this to my ordinary Reader, who elſe would perhaps hardly believe that it is I, who ſtand for <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience,</hi> that grant the Magiſtrate his due power in things <hi>Sacred</hi> as well as <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil:</hi> and it is he, is not tender enough of it, when denying him what is his due (the uſe of his Sword or power) in things Religious, he hath left him without a rule or bounds to his commands in <hi>other</hi> matters. If I appear to drive on my purpoſe in this, and other of my
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56450:40"/>Books more <hi>dryly</hi> and <hi>ſcantily,</hi> then in a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or Subjects ſo <hi>capacious</hi> might be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, let not the Judicious Reader impute that to me as a fault, which is a thing ſo much to be wiſhed in the writings of others, that I do ſingle out the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the main thing alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether which is to be ſought, and I do by no means deflect from it, leaving whatſoever elſe the matter may lead to, as more copious, and where none of the knot lyes, to the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lums of others.</p>

               <p>The firſt of theſe Books then, is, <hi>A Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Eccleſiaſtical Polity,</hi> the deſign whereof, as to the ſubſtance, conſiſts in the giving a <hi>Superiority</hi> to the Magiſtrate <hi>over the Conſcience,</hi> that in all <hi>doubtful</hi> or diſputable caſes, <hi>viz.</hi> in all matters in their nature <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> (he means according to his Scope, in all matters now in difference between the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt, and Non-Conformiſt) a man muſt account according to that Authors opinion, that if he act againſt the dictates of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, out of obedience to the lawful Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates commands, he does but as a Chriſtian, and is juſtifyed by him in the doing. A Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that I take to be not only new and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terodox,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56450:40"/>but dangerous to Religion, and the opening a door to the pleaſing of man and ſeeking preſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ment, above keeping a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience before God. In things <hi>apparently</hi> and <hi>intrinſecally</hi> evil, he grants that the Magiſtrate is not to be obeyed. But how can this ſtand on its foundation, if conſcience had not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly an authority <hi>over</hi> the <hi>commands of the Magiſtrate,</hi> and the authority of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate not <hi>over conſcience,</hi> as he ſpeaks? There need no more proof that conſcience muſt have the ſuperiority in <hi>every</hi> thing, then to yeild it in <hi>any</hi> thing, ſeeing it is the conſcience of every particular perſon is the judge to him of what God has forbidden; and the command of God muſt take place of the command of men in all things alike whatſoever. If this eminently accompliſhed young Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine then be not too proud to take it kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I would help him out here, according to the beſt that I think can be done. There is the conſcience of the <hi>univerſality:</hi> and of <hi>particular</hi> perſons. When he ſays, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates Authority is over the conſcience, let us underſtand his meaning to be onely as to the conſcience of ſuch particulars, which in ſome ſenſe may be granted, while he paſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Law upon the account that it is <hi>according</hi> to the conſciences of the <hi>Generality,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56450:41"/>it proves <hi>againſt</hi> theirs. And then whereas he ſpeaks often to this purpoſe, that the conſcience being in <hi>doubt,</hi> a man ſhould in all matters indifferent make the <hi>Law,</hi> or <hi>will of the Magiſtrate</hi> his rule; Let us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him favourably, that he means onely when a man is ſatisfied in the main of the thing that it is lawful, and there remains only ſome ſcruples that are fit to be ſhaken off; in which caſe Divines I think do ordinarily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe it to be ſafeſt to obey the Law. But this is to be known alſo, that the conſcience is not to be accounted <hi>doubtful</hi> in this caſe, but <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied;</hi> and troubled only as the Travellour is with the <hi>Scrupuli</hi> the gravel in his Shooe, which he throws out and walks on; whereas if his feet be really wounded, and he does ſo, he may be undone. That this may be the better reliſhed, I will entreat this perſon to take good heed, onely to a certain Book, which is another ſuch a one as his, and came out then, and I ſuppoſe he likes well, a Book entituled <hi>Toleration diſcuſſed,</hi> where he may read theſe paſſages for his inſtruction; <hi>Am I to believe every thing to be indifferent, which the Magiſtrate tells me is ſo, though it be wicked? No,</hi> he anſwers, (<hi>Sect.</hi> 21.) <hi>You are bound there by a Superiour Law, and to your ſelf you are Judge.</hi> Again, <hi>I am ſo far</hi> (in another
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56450:41"/>place) <hi>from adviſing you to renounce your reaſon, that on the contrary, I would have you abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guided and concluded by it: and only to obey for quiets ſake, ſo far as you can poſſibly obey in conſcience.</hi> Again, <hi>The Magiſtrate is a publick Miniſter, and his Commiſſion reaches not to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular conſciences. On the other ſide, there is as little reaſon for any ones private opinion to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate on a publick Law. So that if I miſtake not, we are upon accord thus far, That every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular is to look to one, and the King to the whole.</hi> Again, <hi>The King is accountable to God for the welfare of his people, and you are accountable to God for the good of your little particular. If you cannot obey the Law, do not, but abide the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> And finally, when he hath balanced all the intereſt he can for the <hi>Law,</hi> with this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> he hath the ſame cloze. <hi>And yet I ſay ſtick to your conſcience.</hi> I do cite theſe paſſages with pleaſure, to ſee a reverence to conſcience in the heart of the <hi>Gentleman</hi> who wrot that Book, and that meerly out of conviction, when the <hi>Divine</hi> who wrot this Diſcourſe of Eccleſiaſtical polity hath ſo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it, as if in the whole matters which are now in agitation between all parties in the Nation, the Magiſtrates Authority alone ſhould ſatisfie every body. <hi>When the Dictates of a private conſcience</hi> (ſays he) <hi>happen to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56450:42"/>thwart the determinations of the publick Laws, they in that caſe looſe their binding power,</hi> with ſeveral paſſages to that purpoſe, which is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a fair beginning (as is intimated) for the making the Rulers favour, and a mans own advancement, very quickly all his Religion. The Magiſtrate then (which I offer, as what himſelf, and this Gentleman intends) in the paſſing any Law, the matter whereof is againſt any of his Subjects conſciences, is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to go by a Judgement on the <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> and thoſe Laws to be ſuppoſed <hi>according</hi> to conſcience, becauſe they are according to his own, and thoſe of the generality, when elſe they could not be paſſed without ſinning againſt God. In the mean time every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man for himſelf is to obey onely with ſubordination to his conſcience, and is not to have Ghoſtly encouragement, to go againſt the Dictates of it, upon any ſcore. Which as it may ſerve for the information of <hi>the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> who will receive it perhaps from ſuch a hand, when he would not elſe from mine; ſo may it give me occaſion to ask <hi>the Gentleman</hi> two queſtions: The one is, what if any ſuch things ſhould again come to be put in a Bill at the Houſe, which the King does believe really is againſt the conſcience of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, or of ſuch a particular number at leaſt,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56450:42"/>as is fit and neceſſary for him to take cogne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of them? Can he paſs ſuch a Bill in point of conſcience? The other then follows, whether the preſſing this Nation in the main to <hi>Conformity,</hi> is not really ſuch a thing at this ſeaſon, when the generality are ſo divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their opinions? I require here no more candour in the Gentleman then what he hath ſhewen in that laſt work. Who as I found him a lover of learning and reading in theſe preſent deboſhed times, ſhould not eſcape my praiſe (notwithſtanding others <hi>odium</hi>) for his induſtry and ſufficiency, (eſpecially as one of the Laity) if the <hi>deſign</hi> of his writings had been but as commendable as the <hi>example.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>The other Book is, thoſe papers entituled <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> which are of another complexion, and moulded with no leſs inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of <hi>matter,</hi> then the other in <hi>expreſſion.</hi> I am very well ſatisfied with the fulneſs, apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and conviction of the arguments for that Liberty I read there: nevertheleſs I do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the main ſtate of the very point, does require farther ventilation. If I do provoke that Learned and excellingly worthy perſon by this means to write again on this Subject,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56450:43"/>I ſhall (I think) do the World ſome ſervice, and perhaps bring more light to my own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>
               <p>The ſubſtance of the whole in his ſtating this buſineſs, I take it comes to this; <hi>The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is the Officer of God to ſee his will exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, which un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the firſt place therefore, There is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction among D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vines, which is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this Gentleman goes upon, that he hath drawn beyond the Staple. This diſtinction, if you conſult their <hi>common places</hi> on that Head <hi>De Magiſtratu,</hi> you ſhall find made by theſe two queſtions: <hi>Whether the Magiſtrate is to take care of Religion? Whether he is to compel his Subjects to it?</hi> And when the former ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally is granted, the latter is denyed. This ſtudious, perſon, it is like, meeting with this hint in ſome of his Books, hath ſuffered a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception into theſe thoughts, that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate therefore hath indeed ſomething to do
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56450:43"/>about Religion, but he is not to <hi>uſe his Sword</hi> about it. For the making his conceptions out, after he hath ingenuouſly off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>red three opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as extremes, in ſome that make the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate the ſole judge of all matters Spiritual and Temporal: in others that affirm the like power but to be exerciſed in Spirituals, in a perfect ſubſerviency to the Clergy: in a third that make him have nothing to do but in civil matters only, he does endeavour to find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a middle way, wherein the Magiſtrate ſhall have his <hi>ſomething to do</hi> (a he ſpeaks), and <hi>not all to do</hi> in theſe matters, &amp; then offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his notion of what has <hi>ſomething he hath to do,</hi> is, which is to be <hi>the great Officer</hi> or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter <hi>of God upon Earth to ſee his will,</hi> which in Religion be accounts onely what he hath revealed <hi>to be put in executive,</hi> he does put in for the resk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing that Liberty, which he would aſſert for the Conſcience, that <hi>under the Goſpel he muſt do this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the manner alſo that Chriſt hath appointed, and ſo not by the temporal Sword.</hi> A great miſtake! The office it ſelf of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is to bear the Sword, and by that to act or effect what it has to do. Where a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath no power of Coercion, he acts not as a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> but as another man, and to ſay he may not uſe his Sword <hi>in the concerns of the Goſpel,</hi> is all one as to deny him any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56450:44"/>any care, any concernment about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion at all. The <hi>Sword</hi> ſays <hi>Bracton</hi> does ſignifie <hi>poteſtatem Regni,</hi> and this muſt be laid down for a truth undeniable, that unto what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Power or Government of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate extends, his Sword muſt. What he can command, he may compel: and where he cannot compel he cannot command. It is in vain (I mean) to talk of <hi>rule,</hi> if he have not power to puniſh when his command is not fulfilled. The meaning then of our Divines by their diſtinction at firſt, is, that Faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed cannot be conſtrained, and ſo men are not to be driven into Religion by force, but yet that the <hi>care</hi> which the Magiſtrate is to have, for maintaining the true Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received, is <hi>Authoratative,</hi> and to be man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, not <hi>precario,</hi> but by his <hi>Sword,</hi> is with them alſo out of queſtion.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, Here is a difference ſeems to be put between the Law and the Goſpel, as to the Magiſtrates ſeeing Gods will executed in the manner he hath appointed: whereas that <hi>manner God hath appointed in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his will performed,</hi> is only that his Officer ſhould act agreeably to the light of nature, or right reaſon, in applying ſuch means as are proper to that end, whether under the Law or Goſpel. For magiſtracy it ſelf, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56450:44"/>of its actings both, ſo far as concerns Gods appointment, we are to conſider does derive from <hi>Nature,</hi> and not from <hi>Poſitive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</hi> By the manner which Chriſt hath appointed under the Goſpel, he muſt either mean ſomething in <hi>oppoſition</hi> to the uſe of the Sword: or <hi>not</hi> in oppoſition to it. If ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in oppoſition, it muſt be as much as if he had ſaid that the Magiſtrate muſt ſee Chriſts will executed by ſome other way then the uſe of his Sword, whereas there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way or manner <hi>quâ Migiſtrate,</hi> he can ſee any thing done. The uſe of his Sword is nothing but the uſing his Authority or Office, which I have ſaid juſt now, and that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not act <hi>as a Magiſtrate</hi> any otherwiſe. If he mean ſomething not in oppoſition hereunto, then cannot his conſequence be valid, that the Magiſtrate muſt ſee Chriſts will done, <hi>onely in the manner he hath appointed, and therefore not by the uſe of his Sword,</hi> ſeeing the cauſing it to be done in <hi>Chriſt manner,</hi> and the <hi>uſe of the Sword</hi> will ſtand together. And what is it then indeed he means by this <hi>manner Chriſt hath appointed?</hi> I turn to his Book and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend by this <hi>manner</hi> he underſtands nothing but by the means and Ordinances Chriſt hath appointed. The people are to be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſtianity and obey the Goſpel, but it
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56450:45"/>muſt be by preaching, and the uſe of the like means; for <hi>Faith comes by hearing,</hi> and by force a man cannot be made to believe. Well now the Magiſtrate is to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e the <hi>means</hi> Chriſt hath appointed to be <hi>uſed</hi> for the ſetting up the Chriſtian Religion, therefore he muſt not uſe his Sword to the end. I anſwer the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect contrary does follow, therefore he may uſe it, ſeeing by his Sword or Authority it is that he muſt cauſe theſe means to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred. It is true the <hi>will of Chriſt</hi> is that the people believe in him, and obey him, but it is not his will that they ſhould believe in him without the uſe of the means. <hi>How can we believe without a Preacher?</hi> when the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate then here is to ſee his will executed, the meaning is, he is to ſee the means uſed, that the people may be brought to believe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him, and to this purpoſe he may and muſt uſe his Sword, if there be occaſion for it. He may and muſt puniſh the Miniſter and others, if they neglect to do their Officer.</p>
               <p>In the third place, this poſition ſeems to put a difference between the matter of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>other</hi> matters, in reference to the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence inferred; <hi>viz.</hi> as if the Magiſtrate act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſeeing Gods will executed in no other manner then God does approve, muſt not uſe the Temporal Sword in <hi>Religious,</hi> when he
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56450:45"/>may in <hi>other</hi> matters: whereas there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference indeed to be put between Things and Things upon this account (for ſome things come not within the Verge hereof, and ſome do), but theſe Things and Things are not rightly ſtated <hi>Religious</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> matters. This cloud doubtleſs ariſes from hence. In regard that in matters of Religion the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is ſuppoſed to be concerned, when it is not ordinarily in other things, therefore are Religious matters conceived as reciprocal here with the whole matter of conſcience, wherein indeed the diſtinction does lye, which is to be made in oppoſition to other matters.</p>
               <p>The fourth cloud is upon the conſequence it ſelf. It follows not from the Magiſtrate act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in no other manner then God approves in the ſeeing his will performed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot uſe his Sword in the concerns of Religion. The King of <hi>Ninive</hi> Decrees a faſt in honour to the true God, not be neglected we may be ſure without puniſhment by any. <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezar</hi> Decrees that no body ſpeak amiſs of the Jews God, under the pain of being cut in pieces. <hi>Attaxerxes</hi> gives Commiſſion to <hi>Ezra,</hi> that <hi>whoſoever would not obey the Law of his God, judgement ſhould be executed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto death, or unto baniſhment, or to confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of goods, or to impriſonment.</hi> Indeed
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56450:46"/>theſe Princes being Heathen, who believed more Gods then their own, are not to be conceived to decree any thing hereby againſt their proper Religion, or the conſciences of of the people upon whom this is impoſed: but for the uſe of Sword, in the matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as in other matters it is expreſs in theſe inſtances, to paſs by what may be heaped hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Kings of <hi>Judah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt cloud or clouds then follow, that having had difference made there where it needs not, we have indeed no difference made there where it needs. For beſides that when the Magiſtrate is ſaid to be Gods Miniſter to ſee his will in general to be executed, it ought to be laid down with reſtriction to mens out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acts only, and a <hi>ſalvo</hi> to his power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive of duty in indifferent things, there are moreover theſe two Diſtinctions mainly lacking for the determining this matter; and which are the groundwork of the whole Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercitation.</p>
               <p>The one is, that whether things be Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or Secular, under the Goſpel or under the Law, we muſt diſtinguiſh between thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acts which are <hi>againſt mens conſciences,</hi> and thoſe that are <hi>not againſt them.</hi> This is the chief thing to be held faſt. In ſuch acts which are againſt mens conſciences, it is true,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56450:46"/>and a vehement truth, the Magiſtrate acting in that manner, God hath appointed cannot uſe his Temporal Sword. It is not agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Law of Nature, or rule of human reaſon, to work upon the conſcience with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward force, and the manner God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Magiſtrate to act in (as was ſaid e'en now) is no other but to act agreeable hereunto. Yet is not the reaſon for this, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on which I chooſe to ſtand here, ſo much, from the <hi>manner</hi> wherein the Magiſtrate is to act (leaſt that alone be to infirm to bear the ſtreſs is laid upon it): as from the <hi>matter</hi> he is to ſee done. That which he is to ſee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed is Gods will, and I ſay that thoſe acts; (theſe outward acts he were otherwiſe to ſee done) which are againſt mens conſciences, are the matter of his <hi>forbidden will;</hi> and ſo muſt he let them alone; But as for all other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acts of men, which are not againſt their conſciences, Let the Magiſtrate ſee that what he requires be for the good of his people, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for their Spiritual or Temporal good, (as whatſoever he requires, which is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods Law, we may conceive like to be), and whether they be Religious or Civil, he is under the Goſpel as well as under the Law, Gods Miniſter, and beareth not the Sword in vaine.</p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:56450:47"/>
               <p>The other, diſtinction which muſt not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten does lye in the difference, I put between a forcing men to that which is <hi>againſt</hi> their conſciences: and reſtraining them ſometimes from that which they think they are <hi>bound</hi> to do. The one of theſe may be lawful, fit, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and without which the Government it ſelf can hardly be ſecured: when the other is never to be held ſo, upon that one reaſon mentioned, and is irrefragable. Here then are two Queſtions in thoſe ingenuous Papers, propoſed to the life, as the ſum of what could be deſired if they had but been directly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered when propoſed: The one is, <hi>How far men muſt be ſuffered to do thoſe things which they ſay they are in conſcience obliged to do?</hi> The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>rence (I account before) as to ſome things which (in relation to what is aſſerted) admits none: ſo muſt the confounding that here, wherein the difference bring put is ſo much to purpoſe, needs lead him into darkneſs. To theſe two queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons therefore I anſwer, inſtead of thoſe Papers.</p>
               <p>As to the former, which is <hi>the caſe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56450:47"/>only of reſtraint,</hi> I doubt not but men may and ought to be reſtrained often times in many things, unto which they think themſelves to be obliged, and that for this reaſon: Becauſe that although God does require every man to act in whatſoever he does according to his conſcience, yet he requires not in every thing that is according to his conſcience, he ſhould act. His conſcience may be Erroneous, or the thing not expedient, if lawful to be done. Again, the Magiſtrates conſcience and his are two; He may think he is bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to act (ſuppoſe in preaching ſeditious Doctrine), yet if upon reſtraint he acts not, his conſcience cannot accuſe him of ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he cannot help it, and the Magiſtrates reſtraining him is good, and thereupon the does it, for avoiding the evil that would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low if he ſhould ſuffer him.</p>
               <p>As to the latter queſtion, which is the <hi>caſe of conſtraint, viz.</hi> the conſtraining of men to do any thing which is againſt their conſcience, I ſay the Magiſtrate hath in that caſe no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and that for this one reaſon, which is to be inſiſted on to the laſt breach of theſe Papers, <hi>viz</hi> becauſe, this is manifeſtly againſt his Office or work, who being to ſee <hi>Gods Will</hi> performed, does hereby directly endeavour the contrary. His <hi>will</hi> is the man ſhould never
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56450:48"/>act againſt his conſcience whatſoever comes of it, &amp; he is forcing him hereunto. Let me add, Either the conſcience of a man is in an error: or it is in the right; If it erre not, a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is as God to him, who can ſay a word againſt it? If it be erroneous, I ſay Gods <hi>will</hi> lyes in both theſe things: that a man ſhould not do againſt his conſcience, becauſe it is his conſcience: and that he ſhould not do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his conſcience, becauſe it erres, but that he ſhould lay down his error, and ſo act. And this is the meaning of that which Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines do ſay, that ſuch a conſcience does <hi>ligare</hi> not <hi>obligare.</hi> The Magiſtrate accordingly may not compel him to that which is <hi>poſitive</hi> to act againſt his conſcience: but to that which is <hi>negative, viz.</hi> not to act according to it: and if he do, and do wickedly, no doubt but he may puniſh him for it. And ſo having of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered you my Determination, I am glad I can confirm it and that with two teſtimonies like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, moſt of ſufficient credit. The one is St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his ſecond Book, and Chapter 83. againſt <hi>Petilian,</hi> who pleading the unlawfulneſs of compelling them to Religion, <hi>Auſtin</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers: <hi>Ad fidem quidem nullus est cogendus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitus, ſed per ſeveritatem ſolet perfidia caſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri: Si quae erga vos leges conſtitutae ſunt, non eis benefacere cogimini, ſed malefacere prohibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini;

               <p>There are two Notes I muſt leave farther; The one is that when I have laid down my two diſtinctions for the determining this point, you muſt take beed of going away with one of them. I know S. <hi>Auguſtins</hi> ſeventeenth Chapter in his ſecond Book againſt the ſecond Epiſtle of <hi>Gaudentius,</hi> hath this Title, <hi>quod ad veritatem cogendi ſint etiam inviti,</hi> which he makes good with theſe two inſtances, of the King of <hi>Ninives</hi> commanding his people to repent: and the Servants compelling them to come in to the Feaſt under the Goſpel. But neither of theſe Commands I hope (and as I have ſaid) are to be ſuppoſed againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of the one or the other, but only they were unwilling and negligent, and ſo had need of importunity and enforcement. I deny not therefore but the Magiſtrate hath power (N.B.) of <hi>Conſtraint</hi> and <hi>Reſtraint</hi> in the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56450:49"/>of Religion:</hi> but I ſay he hath not power of <hi>Constraint</hi> in matters <hi>Religious</hi> (or other matters) which are <hi>againſt a mans conſcience.</hi> The other Note is, that when I have diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed between <hi>Reſtraint</hi> and <hi>Conſtraint</hi> in the matter of <hi>Conſcience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> (not in the general matters only of <hi>Religion</hi>), it does not ſeem to me ſafe to deſcend to particulars, what is, and what is not to be <hi>reſtrained:</hi> but in general the Magiſtrate may uſe a due reſtraint when he hath reaſon, and it is not fit he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain any when he hath none. There is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Magiſtrate ſhould reſtrain a <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> and <hi>Knipperdoling,</hi> when he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed none againſt a peaceable <hi>Owen,</hi> and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt <hi>Kiffin.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour may have cauſe in general to take heed of innovation, and yet have no cauſe to diſturb the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, of whom <hi>Pliny</hi> wrot to <hi>Traian.</hi> By this means ſhall it not follow either that Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſhould be ever kept out of the World, or that when Religion is eſtabliſhed, it muſt be overturned again by faction: but that ſuch a liberty only be allowed to conſcience, as is conſiſtent with the Articles of Faith, a good Life, and the Government of the Nation.</p>

               <head>SECT. 10.</head>
               <p>Suppoſe we now then a Magiſtrate deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to bring his People to a Religion, or to a Uniformity in that way of worſhip he himſelf beſt approves; What may he do therein? The firſt thing he may and is to do, is doubtleſs to take care that the people have Inſtruction; that the Word be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and ſuch means uſed which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to convince their underſtandings, and ſatisfie their conſciences, that they may ſubmit to it. This is the chief I count he is to do. In the next place he may and is to cauſe all thoſe <hi>impediments</hi> to be removed, which may obſtruct them in the reception of this Religion. So <hi>Cyrus</hi> by his authority repreſſed the <hi>Jews</hi> enemies, and made the way open for their return, and rebuilding <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> In the laſt place, the Magiſtrate may tender all the encouragements and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages (with a reſtraint of the ſame to the refuſers) that he can poſſible, to win them over to the way he conceives good for them. When he hath gone thus far he muſt make a ſtand, and conſider in good earneſt whether that which he would impoſe, be
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56450:50"/>againſt their Conſciences or no. If it be not he may proceed to lay his Injunctions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; whereby an obligation does fall upon the conſcience (ſuppoſing the thing reaſonable, and for the common good) to do what his will is; and if they do it not hereupon, he may by the infliction of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment (that is by his Temporal Sword) enforce them to a due obedience: In ſumm, He may do all and the very ſame in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of Religion, as he may do in the other concerns of his Kingdom, upon that ſuppoſition.</p>
               <p>But if it be againſt their Conſciences, he can proceed no farther. He cannot lay any obligation on the Conſcience, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that wherein it ſtands bound alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and where he can lay no obligation on the conſcience, he cannot <hi>ex imperio</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; and where he cannot command and oblige the Conſcience (as human law does bind it, which how, and how far it does, is ſtated in my other book), he cannot juſtly puniſh the man for not doing that which he was not bound to do. So that we ſee here where the Magiſtrate muſt not uſe his Sword, even while he is uſing it, and acts not as a Magiſtrate but by it. He acts by his authority or ſword, in ſeeing the means
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56450:50"/>uſed, helps adminiſtred, obſtacles removed. He can, and may force others (whoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it is) not to be wanting in this, when he cannot then enforce the end to which he cauſes theſe means to be uſed. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not (I mean, he ought not) puniſh any man only becauſe his Conſcience is not wrought upon by the means which he has uſed, and ſo does not what he would have him. In this caſe, it is not he, or the man either can help it, and he may as well beat his Dog for not whiſtling.</p>
               <p>Upon this account, there is very good reaſon that regard be had ſo much the more to things that are not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable without ſupernatural help, that they be not enforced as other things. So that we are to underſtand well after this, that the diſtinctions between the Religious and Secullar things, in reference to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates Authority, or uſing his Sword, is for all what is before ſaid, to be held ſo far as it will reach: but that is only to a <hi>majus &amp; minus</hi> of his <hi>Care,</hi> not to the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification of the ſtate of our buſineſs. My meaning is, that in things not Religious, but Moral only, or Civil, the Magiſtrate is more free as to his commands, and uſing his Sword than in matters of Religion; or
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56450:51"/>he is to take more care of what he impoſes in the one, than he need to do in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but that will not advance to the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the point hereupon, that he hath Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and may uſe his Sword in <hi>Civil</hi> and not in <hi>Sacred</hi> concerments. The King under the Law was to have the Book of God by him to this end, that he might govern the people according to it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently uſe his Authority in the things of Religion: And ſo <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> (to name no other) appoints his Officers for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtice in the <hi>matters of God,</hi> as in the <hi>Kings matters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Propoſition, The Magiſtrate may uſe his Sword in Civil, but not in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous affairs, is not a true Propoſition, and therefore can determine nothing. And this Propoſition, The Magiſtrate is to take <hi>more heed</hi> how he uſes his Sword in <hi>ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> than in <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>civil</hi> concerns, is a true Propoſition, but not a ſufficient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination. The main Queſtion ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains. What are thoſe things wherein the Magiſtrate indeed hath no power, or may not uſe his Sword? Upon the knowledg of this muſt the ſtating the buſineſs depend; for when we know in what things he <hi>may,</hi> and in what he <hi>may not</hi> uſe his Authority,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56450:51"/>the matter is at an end. Here are we now therefore to think upon it, what are thoſe <hi>reaſons,</hi> why the Magiſtrate is to be more careful in the uſe of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in <hi>Religious</hi> than in <hi>other</hi> matters, and if it be any where, it is like to be there that we ſhall find a bottom to determine the main iſſue. To know theſe reaſons, look whatſoever difference there are to be made between <hi>Religious</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> matters in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Magiſtrates uſing his Sword about them, and they muſt be theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>The firſt difference then between Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and Civil things, that may be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as a reaſon why the Magiſtrate is to take more care of uſing his Sword in the one than the other, is, That Religious things are ſuppoſed to be of ſupernatural Revelation, which cannot therefore be known and done without Gods grace, and it is not fit the Magiſtrate ſhould puniſh a man for the want of that which God does not give him: When in Moral and Civil things he hath the knowledg of them only by Nature, and the practiſe of the Realm. Now then if this will ſerve to determine the Queſtion, the Propoſition drawn from it muſt be this: That in all matters that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56450:52"/>are of ſupernatural Revelation, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate may <hi>not</hi> uſe his Sword, but in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he <hi>may</hi> uſe it. But this Propoſition is alike falſe with the firſt, That in all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious he may not, and in all Civil he may. The Law given by <hi>Moſes</hi> was by Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the Magiſtrates might puniſh the breakers of that Law. The Goſpel is by Revelation, but the Magiſtrate may puniſh thoſe that keep from Church out of Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. The example of the man that was put to death for gathering Sticks on the Sabbath, is a preſident uncontroulable, that a man may be puniſhed for his Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when he may not for his Conſcience, in the matters of Religion.</p>
               <p>The ſecond difference between Sacred and Civil affairs, which may be another reaſon why the Magiſtrate is to take more heed as to the one than to the other, is, That the World cannot be governed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the exerciſe of his Authority in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, when if the world were without all that which is of ſupernatural Revelation (and conſequently, if he meddles not at all with thoſe things) it might. It appears then reaſonable, that in what the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World can be without, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56450:52"/>ſhould not be ſo preſſing, when in that which it cannot ſubſiſt without, he muſt. Let us then again draw out what is here, and try if it will do. In matters which the world may be governed without, the Magiſtrate muſt not uſe his Sword; but in matters without which it cannot be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, he may. This Propoſition labours with the ſame failing: for, the Magiſtrate may uſe his Authority in things which the world may be governed if it were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, becauſe he can uſe it in <hi>religious</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as hath been inſtanced already from Scripture.</p>
               <p>A third difference between Sacred and Civil things; and which is a reaſon, why the Magiſtrate is to be more careful of his injunctions, and uſing his Sword in the one above the other, is, Becauſe it is more like that the things he impoſes in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious concerns ſhould be againſt mens conſciences, than in Civil or Moral matters, and the Magiſtrate hath no Authority over the Conſcience of any. It is the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the moſt High, that no man ſhould ever do any thing againſt his Conſcience, and the Magiſtrate cannot uſe his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but for God. Now let us ſee if this at laſt
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56450:53"/>will ſerve for the determining the queſtion, and if it will, then muſt this propoſition be true. That in all matters that <hi>are</hi> againſt mens Conſciences the Magiſtrate hath no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and cannot uſe his Sword; but in all matters that are <hi>not</hi> againſt their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or that are according to them, he may uſe it. And this propoſition I count is true and certain, and to be maintained even in Religious and Civil matters; and ſo is the foundation concluded upon by me to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh our Determination.</p>

            <div n="11" type="section">
               <head>SECT. 11.</head>
               <p>There is one thing yet ſeems wanting: I do ſpeak here to one branch of the main poſition as falſe, while in things <hi>Religious,</hi> though they could not be known but by Revelation, and the world could be gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without them, I affirm the Magiſtrate hath authority, and may uſe his Sword, as he may in other matters; that is, provided they be not againſt mens Conſciences. But as to the other branch, in things <hi>Civil</hi> and and <hi>Moral,</hi> which men may know by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral light, and in which the Government is more concern'd, I have not ſaid whether it be true or falſe. I will proceed therefore
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56450:53"/>and declare, that as the Poſition laid down at firſt, or the worthy maintainer of it, goes too <hi>low</hi> in denying the Magiſtrate the uſe of his ſword in Religious things, which is to be granted (I count) herein as in other matters, to wit, upon ſuppoſition of both to be not <hi>againſt,</hi> but <hi>according</hi> to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences: So does he go too <hi>high</hi> in yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it in Civils, without the ſame limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereof we muſt be ſtill as tender as of our Eye, or of our Salvation. I do think alſo, of the two, the laſt is the more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous extremity.</p>
               <p>I argue then, If the Magiſtrate may not uſe force, or the temporal Sword in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous affairs, becauſe ſuch things are of that nature as the Conſcience is like to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer'd in them; and if it be againſt their Conſcience it is unlawful: then when the Conſcience likewiſe is concern'd in Civil things, he may not uſe the Sword neither. For if the ground be good in the one, it muſt be good in the other; if it will not hold in both, it may be denied in either. Again, the things perhaps are Civil things, but the man, or men, makes a Conſcience of them, and ſo the caſe muſt be the ſame to them, as if it were in Religion. To make a conſcience of a thing is to look upon it as
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56450:54"/>commanded or forbidden of God, and to go about to perform or avoid it upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. But to do or leave a thing undone upon the account of the command or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of God, is an act of Religion. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently though the thing be <hi>Civil,</hi> yet ſo long as a perſon, or perſons, make a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of it, it is all one to them, I ſay, as if the things were <hi>religious,</hi> and the authority of the Magiſtrate can be no more in the one than the other.</p>
               <p>I will propoſe ſome inſtances. <hi>Doeg</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes the Prieſts to <hi>Saul.</hi> He hears their cauſe, condemns them as Traytors; commands his Servants to do execution upon them, they refuſe the execution; It is againſt their Conſciences. <hi>Saul</hi> here hath no authority over thoſe Servants in this caſe either to command them to act, or to puniſh them for not acting againſt their Conſciences. If they obey him they ſin againſt God. <hi>Saul</hi> might urge here the thing was of Civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, and if all ſhould do as they did, that is, queſtion the Judges ſentence, and refuſe to execute it upon pretence of conſcience, the Government could not ſtand; yet this wont ſerve, they muſt not act againſt their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences for all that. If he falls upon them for it, they muſt bear it; but it will be ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56450:54"/>over them, and injury to Heaven; the ſuperiority of whoſe authority over his, being the thing in effect they aſſerted, by that refuſal. You may ſay, this is an inſtance indeed in Civil things, wherein the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate had not authority; and conſequently when Civil things are impoſed againſt a mans Conſcience, the caſe is the ſame as in Religious. But you will add, the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of theſe men was in the right, and you would have ſome inſtance in Civil things where the Conſcience is erroneous. I will offer you therefore other inſtances. A Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon under <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> is beſieged by the <hi>Turks,</hi> it has but one Well in it, a Traytor throws in a dead Carrion. The Soldiers are under a ſuperſtition that the water here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon is unclean, and that they cannot drink it without ſin. Rather than do ſo they yield the place, otherwiſe impregnable. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance I once uſed elſewhere on another oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. let me offer you one more authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick out of the <hi>Machabees.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> are of the general perſwaſion that they may not fight on the Sabbath. Their enemies come upon them on that day on purpoſe; rather than act againſt their Conſciences they ſuffer themſelves all to be ſlain. I will ask now upon this perſwaſion of theſe men
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56450:55"/>that the doing theſe neceſſary things, as drinking that water, and defending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves was ſin, whether the Captains of thoſe Soldiers could command them to drink, or to fight and force them to it? Nothing can be pleaded of more moment in any caſe. The whole Government and their lives depend on it, and the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might teach them that neceſſity ſhould take place of their ſuperſtition. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs until they had conſulted the thing and their Conſciences were ſatisfied of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of it; that is until they came to find out the ſubſtance of what Chriſt afterward revealed, <hi>That man was not made for the Sabbath, but the Sabbath for man,</hi> There was no Captain or Governour (I ſuppoſe) could have power to command them, or force them in the caſe. I will deſcend to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance frequent in the preſent Nation. It is a Civil thing for any of the King's Courts to grant a Writ for a man to come, and give his teſtimony by Oath to any Cauſe that is before them. I will ſuppoſe now that ſome, and that many, have received the impreſſion, that it is unlawful for them to Swear at all, and thereupon they refuſe to Swear. It may be urged in this caſe, what a civilly evil opinion this is, which is both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56450:55"/>to the Government (in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration), and injurious to particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who may be undone in their Eſtates for want of ſuch an Oath. Nevertheleſs there are many of the <hi>Quakers</hi> ready to go to priſon themſelves, and loſe all their own Eſtates; and we may ſuppoſe their Lives, rather than they will be induced to ſwear. I ask, What will you ſay now to this caſe? Hath the Magiſtrate power over theſe mens Conſciences? If he hath, he may command them to judg, otherwiſe than they do, and puniſh them that they act according to this judgment. And if he can command and uſe his Sword upon them, to make them ſwear, he may, to make them come to <hi>Church;</hi> and if he was a Papiſt Magiſtrate, to come to <hi>Maſs;</hi> and if a heathen Magiſtrate, to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to Idols. If he have not power over their Conſciences, and to command them to have other judgments, then muſt he let them alone (as generally our Juſtices have done), or challenge an authority to make men act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Conſciences, which is to uſe the power which he hath from God, againſt him. If you think there is here ſome differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between ſuch caſes as theſe, and that of the <hi>Machabees</hi> before, it matters little: But if you make none between them, but
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56450:56"/>ſay the Commanders of thoſe <hi>Jews,</hi> and thoſe Soldiers, might have compelled them in thoſe caſes; I ſay, if any of them could, they ought; and they ſhould not have been ſaid then <hi>to dye in their innocency.</hi> I ſay again, if they might, then can a Magiſtrate command and force a man to act againſt his conſcience; then can he command him to ſin; then can he command what God has forbidden; then muſt man be above God. The earth it ſelf methinks can as ſoon be moved, as this foundation.</p>

               <p>What ſhall we ſay then to theſe things? Shall we complain that God Almighty hath put in man ſuch a ſturdy thing as Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is, which makes him ſo often to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come refractory to the commandments of his Superiors, whenſoever they do but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any thing againſt it? No, there is good reaſon, God ſhould maintain to himſelf an Authority above any mortal in the earth, and that his name ſhould be glorified by his ſervants, in the confeſſion of it to be world. Or ſhall we complain of Government, deſiring to be rid of it, as that which is ſo uneaſie to our Conſciences,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56450:56"/>that we cannot hardly ſerve God, but we muſt diſobey man, and incur danger about it? Shall we riſe up therefore in rebellion, and acquit our ſelves? God forbid! It is the will of Heaven who hath put into the heart of man an awe to his inviſible being as our ſupream Lord, to conſtitute the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to bear his Image and repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the earth, that in his perſon, himſelf may be honoured, ſo long as we <hi>obey</hi> only with ſubordination to his will, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, which is the end of his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If neither of theſe, what then? Shall we be e'en content in this ſtate of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and imperfection, when the Fall hath brought ſo much difficulty upon all things elſe, as well as Government, to offer the beſt compoſition we can between the duty the Magiſtrate owes to God and his people, and the obedience the people owe to him and their conſciences; ſo that we may not put off any truth which ſtands irrefragable by the pleading inconvenience, when theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences are by prudence to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and if we do it but as well as we can, that is, as the ſtate of mans corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or human frailty and infirmity will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, it ſuffices, and the reſt muſt be born. Shall we agree upon this? if we ſhall, I have
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56450:57"/>but a little more to ſay hereunto, and I have done.</p>
               <p>The Office of the Magiſtrate is to make the Laws, and to ſee to the execution. In all things as well Religious, I have ſaid as Civil, which are for the peoples good, he may <hi>paſs,</hi> and <hi>execute</hi> any Laws, ſo long as they be agreeable to the Word of God, and mens Conſciences; but he can command or inforce nothing which is againſt mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. This is delivered already. Thoſe things now which are againſt mens Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences (let us conſider in the laſt place, which hath been intimated alſo from one or two occaſions before) are either ſuch as are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality,</hi> or againſt ſo many of their Conſciences as the Magiſtrate is to take Cognizance of them: or, againſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences only of ſo <hi>few</hi> as is not meet for him to take cognizance of them. In the firſt caſe he is not to paſs ſuch a Law I count upon any terms; if he do, he ſins againſt his Charge, and he hath no authority to ſin himſelf, or cauſe any to ſin. In the ſecond, we may ſuppoſe that the Conſciences of a few particular perſons only are not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to put an obſtruction to any law really good for the Community, but it is to be accounted for the univerſalities ſake, to be
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56450:57"/>according to the ſubjects Conſciences, and not againſt them. But when I have ſaid thus as to the <hi>paſſing</hi> of the Law, I muſt ſay alſo that in the <hi>execution</hi> of ſuch Laws, I hold that even thoſe particular perſons ought to be regarded. In order hereunto,</p>
               <p>There are ſome that pretend conſcience of a thing, when indeed they make none of it. Underſtand not this ſo, as if all that could not give a reaſon ſufficient for what they hold, did not make a conſcience of it (which hath cauſe a great prejudice and falſe reckoning of this buſineſs); but when they believe not the thing really in their heart to be ſo as they pretend.</p>
               <p>When men <hi>pretend</hi> they make a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a thing, and indeed <hi>do not,</hi> I would have the Magiſtrate above all men to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Law upon ſuch, (ſuppoſing they judg that Law righteous), and make them an example. If you will ſay, But how ſhall a Magiſtrate know this, ſeeing no man can judg of anothers heart, I acknowledge rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily this is a difficulty, and the chief thing which requires the Magiſtrates prudence and faithfulneſs: Yet this I ſay, That every man for all that being judg of his own acts, and the puniſhing of forbearing a perſon being what the Magiſtrate <hi>does,</hi> he muſt go,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56450:58"/>and can but go, according to his judgment. He uſes the Mediums as a wiſe man does, and lawfully may take his conjecture (the tree is known by his fruit), and it is not neceſſary it ſhould be certain, but only that it be certain he ſo judges, and if he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced in his Soul, and indeed judges the mans profeſſion only to be <hi>pretence,</hi> it is his own judgment, and nothing elſe can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine him. Although where the perſon is ſerious in what he declares, and not under any publick note of perfidiouſneſs, the rule of Charity, <hi>which hopeth all things, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth all things, and thinketh no evil,</hi> muſt encline him to the beſt conſtruction.</p>
               <p>When men <hi>do</hi> truly make the conſcience they <hi>pretend,</hi> let the Juſtice take heed, and ſee that he likewiſe reverence Conſcience, no leſs than they do. If the penalty be ſuch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the man is like to endure it without ſcruple, rather than do that which is againſt his Conſcience, the Magiſtrate may be the bolder in executing that Law upon him: But if it be ſuch as he is like rather to do the thing againſt his Conſcience than ſuffer it, I would not be that Magiſtrate who ſhould put ſuch a Law in execution upon any. In the mean time every particular man for himſelf is to look to his Conſcience as
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56450:58"/>his Judg in the buſineſs of his Soul, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that authority void to him whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, that commands any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what that dictates. And the ſupream Authority is to conceive that thoſe that act under it will uſe prudence upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Which prudence I fear me really in this caſe can hardly be Chriſtian but it muſt come to this, That either they muſt totally forbear, and not ſo much as threaten pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the Law upon ſuch a perſon: or elſe perſwade him firſt to reſolution, to bear the penalty, and not do the thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his conſcience. They muſt in effect ſay thus to the man, If this thing be againſt your Conſcience we adviſe you not to it. If our proſecuting the Law upon you will make you do it rather than ſuffer, we dare not proſecute you to deſtroy your Soul: but if you will for the ſake of the general commodity, or good example, bear the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment rather than do the thing, and we be aſſured of it, then can we do our office without hazard, either of yours, or our own damnation.</p>

               <p>After this, I begin to think what does hinder, but that this worthy Knight my
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56450:59"/>friend and I ſhould reconcile? As for the main buſineſs, we hold together againſt any that ſhall <hi>oppoſe</hi> us, That in all matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> the Magiſtrate may not uſe his Sword to force any againſt their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and ſo long as we agree in the main, we may have leave to abound each in his own ſenſe otherwiſe. The difference then we have under this <hi>agreement</hi> does I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe lie in two things. The one is, That in things <hi>Religious</hi> this Gentleman ſeems to deny the Magiſtrate the uſe of his Sword altogether, and I deny it him not, but meerly when ſuch things are againſt mens Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. And herein methinks he ſhould come over to me, for ſeeing <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> is the thing mainly he is engaged for, in the denial of the Magiſtrate the uſe of his Sword in theſe things, there is no need he ſhould deny it at all when Conſcience is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in them. The other is that in <hi>Civil</hi> things he grants the Magiſtrate the uſe of his Sword, as over liberally as he takes it away in <hi>Religious;</hi> whereas I ſuppoſe that as long as there is ſtill the ſame reaſon, that is, ſo long as the thing is againſt a man's conſcience the Magiſtrate may not force any one to it, whether it be Civil or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. And herein indeed ſhould I be as
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56450:59"/>ready to come over to him, who knows how prudent it muſt ſeem in ſtanding for <hi>Liberty,</hi> to confine it to things of <hi>Supernatural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> leſt the Magiſtrate be offended if we touch on Civils: but that if I did ſo, I muſt really forſake the Patronage of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which I am not willing my ſelf, nor that this Gentleman ſhould do. For if we grant once that Conſcience may be forc'd in any one thing, there may be the ſame or the like reaſon urged to force it in another, and ſo in all, and then here liberty is gone. If we will not ſtand by her in all diſtreſſes, we cannot defend her in any. The ground of alls is, Conſcience is a thing which can be ruled by none but the Almighty. And for as much as all Authority or power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into its original, is, the <hi>will</hi> of God that ſuch a one ſhould <hi>command,</hi> it ſeems not a thing conſonant to reaſon to ſuppoſe it the will of God that a Superiour ſhould require that of a perſon, which it is his will that perſon ſhould not do.</p>
               <p>Things then which are <hi>Civil</hi> may be ſo in themſelves, and yet come under ſome <hi>conſideration</hi> which is <hi>religious,</hi> or may have Religion incidental to them. If this worthy Gentleman be content to hold that in things Civil under <hi>every conſideration</hi> that is but
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56450:60"/>
                  <hi>civil,</hi> the Magiſtrate may uſe his Sword without ſcruple, I yeild to him: but if a thing ſecular does come under a <hi>conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> which is <hi>religious,</hi> and in that conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is againſt a mans Conſcience, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive, but that the caſe is the ſame here as if the matter were it ſelf Religious. For whatſoever the thing be, in that reſpect, as he makes a Conſcience of it, I have ſaid before, it is a point of Religion to him.</p>
               <p>The Fifth-Monarchy-man thinks in his Conſcience, he may not pay Taxes. A ſtrange opinion! Againſt Scripture, Senſe, and Righteouſneſs: Yet if you ask the man his reaſon, he will bring you a Text perhaps out of <hi>Daniel</hi> or the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and the ſum of all will come to this, that if he does, he thinks verily he ſhall receive the <hi>mark of the Beaſt,</hi> and be caſt into the <hi>lake of fire and brimſtone,</hi> and rather than venture that, he will choſe to ſuffer, though it were death. I count this man now as one in a Feaver, that is, touched in his head, and who can help ſuch a conceit? his opinion is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Revelation, and we agree, that in matters of <hi>ſupernatural Revelation,</hi> the Magiſtrate may not force any againſt their Conſciences. What then ſhall he do? I anſwer, In this caſe, and the like as this is,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56450:60"/>it is the management only of the Laws with prudence, will decide ſuch difficulties. It is againſt the mans Conſcience, voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to pay his Tax, it will wound his Soul if he does: but it is not againſt his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, nor will it wound him, that he is aſſeſſed, and that the Officer comes, and diſtrains, and pays himſelf. So long as he bears his teſtimony by a <hi>non-payment,</hi> he is willing to have the money taken by force. And thus does the Officer do right, for the Law is, he ſhall pay, or be diſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and the man keeps his Conſcience, and no hurt is done. But if a Magiſtrate would not be content here, unleſs the man payes his money <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> and by way of acknowledging his Authority from God, or elſe he will hang him, or burn him, I have not a heart ſo hard to juſtifie any ſuch rigor, which appears more than <hi>needs.</hi> Unto this inſtance, no doubt but we may ſuppoſe many more, wherein there may be required of perſons ſome things which are apparently their duty (as this rendring to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things which are <hi>Caeſars,</hi> is,) by the Law of God, as well as man, and yet in regard of ſome principles ſome have received, or ſome circumſtances they are in, they are againſt their Conſciences: You
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56450:61"/>may ask therefore in general, Does not the Magiſtrate well to uſe his Sword, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Law upon offenders in ſuch caſes? I anſwer, no doubt but he does; becauſe he acts upon ſuppoſition, that ſuch things are according to their Conſciences, and he is not to ſuppoſe otherwiſe: Nevertheleſs, if it come within his cognizance, that the thing indeed is a matter of Conſcience to him, I do humbly apprehend, and ſay, that the great duty of Charity which he owes to his brothers Soul, and is above any Law of man, ought to prevail with him for ſome ſuch <hi>middle courſe</hi> in the <hi>execution</hi> of the Law, that neither may the man be hurt in his Religion, nor the publick ſuffer by his ill example: but that both his Conſcience be regarded, and righteouſneſs alſo take place.</p>
               <p>You may ſay perhaps, You would indeed have the magiſtrate have a care, and not force a man to any thing againſt his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: but you think notwithſtanding, he may very comfortably puniſh him, if he do not what was enjoyned. I will ask then, For what could you comfortably puniſh him, for being true only to his Conſcience, which is to be faithful to God? I do not find, if I were a Magiſtrate, that I could have any great comfort in that. Indeed if
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56450:61"/>a man were <hi>doing,</hi> or <hi>does</hi> a thing which is evil or deſtructive to the Government and common good, though it be according to his own Conſcience or judgment but what he ought to do, I think the Magiſtrate may puniſh him with comfort, and may reſtrain him more comfortably from what he would do: but I do not think he may puniſh him with any ſuch content for <hi>not</hi> doing that which yet were good, ſo long as it is againſt his Conſcience. My reaſon I give is this, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the one, the man does what God would not have him: in the other, he does what God would have. God would not have him do evil becauſe of his erroneous Conſcience, but that he ſhould lay down his error and do good: but God will have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man ſo regard his Conſcience, though erroneous, that he muſt not do any thing againſt it, for any fear or advantage in the world. Again, as for what cauſe, I will ask, For what end could you puniſh him? Is it for the moſt ordinary end of puniſhment, the parties amendment, that is, the making the man do what he now leaves undone? I anſwer, Then your diſtinction here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes void, when you ſay, you would not force him to any thing againſt his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but you can puniſh him; for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56450:62"/>forcing a man to any thing againſt his Conſcience, is to puniſh him for not doing the thing to make him do it. Or is it only for example ſake to others? If ſo, Then muſt theſe others be either ſuch as the thing is alſo againſt their Conſciences, and then I ſay, you are no more to puniſh one man, to enforce others thereby to do againſt their Conſciences, than to force him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to act againſt it: Or theſe others muſt be ſuch as it is not againſt their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, though againſt his, and in ſuch a caſe, if their be indeed a puniſhment can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, ſo as will not be inductive, either to the man himſelf, or others, to do the thing which is againſt their Conſciences, but will only induce others, who can do it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theirs, to the doing, I am not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful though it be executed upon any; yet cannot ſay ſteadily, that you may exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it, becauſe the very nature of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſuch, as unleſs it be for a fault, and that wich deſerves it, there is no other end without this, can juſtifie the infliction of it. You ſee at laſt ſtill unto what all will be reduced. Things <hi>are,</hi> or things are <hi>not</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt mens Conſciences. And there is a forcing <hi>poſitively,</hi> or <hi>negatively.</hi> Underſtand theſe terms as I have unfolded my ſelf, and

               <p>I remember in the life of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> when ſome of the <hi>Trachonites</hi> came in for reſcue to the <hi>Jews,</hi> where himſelf was Governor, and the <hi>Jews</hi> would thereupon conſtrain them to be circumciſed, or elſe let them not abide with them, he would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that injurious zeal, alledging, "That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man ought according to his own mind, and not by mans compulſion, to ſerve God. In our Engliſh ſtory (to ſuit this), when <hi>Ethelbert</hi> the firſt Prince that received Chriſtianity of the <hi>Sexon</hi> Heptar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, was converted by <hi>Auſtine,</hi> ſent hither by <hi>Gregory,</hi> and many thereupon came into the Church, it is ſaid, "He ſpecially embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thoſe that came in, but compelled none, for he had learned, that the faith and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Chriſt ought to be voluntary, and not of conſtraint.

               <p>By this little and by all the reſt, we may ſee what a difference there is, and ought to be of judgment, according to diverſity of ſtates, and circumſtances in this buſineſs. It is certainly true on both ſides; On the one, that Laws and Puniſhments are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily the direct means to ſuppreſs any evil that is growing, and conſequently any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſect, or opinion, that the Ruler ſhall think fit to ſuppreſs: On the other, that Perſecution is the moſt quick and active courſe, to engage the hearts and ſpirits of the believing and zealous, in their way which is Religious, and wherein they judg that God ſtill muſt be obeyed before man, above any other (even of Preferment it ſelf) that could be invented to do it. And conſequently, when we have ſtated the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56450:68"/>power, whereby we come to ſee what he may ſtrictly do in theſe matters, we muſt leave him at the laſt to prudential conſiderations ſtill, whether he had beſt to exert that power or no, and what is beſt in the exerting of it, according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of this people. For my own part, I am here in <hi>Genere demonſtrativo,</hi> not in <hi>Genere deliberativo.</hi> And I may debate with that Gentleman in the one, unto whoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments I would refer to chuſe of any, in the other.</p>
               <p>There are two Rules in the Preamble of the Statute <hi>primo Mariae.</hi> The one is that the ſtate of a King ſtandeth more aſſured by the love of his Subjects, than in the dread and fear of Laws. The other is, That Laws juſtly made without extream puniſhment, are more often, and for the moſt part better obeyed than thoſe that are made with that extremity. Unto which the before named Lord Chief Juſtice Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> ſubjoyns this ſentence, <hi>Mitius imperanti, melius pare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> I will cloſe up all with that gracious end of one Speech of the preſent Lord Keeper to the Parliament. If any juſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances ſhall have happened, his Majeſty will be as willing and ready to redreſs them as you to have them preſented to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56450:68"/>him: And his Majeſty doubts not but you will give healing and moderate Counſels, and imprint that known truth in the hearts of his Subjects, That there is no diſtinct intereſt between the King and his people, but the good of one, is the good of both.</p>
